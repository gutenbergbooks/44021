<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>The present work is the outcome of a wish expressed to me from
more than one quarter that I would reprint in a collected form, for
the convenience of historical students, some more results of my
researches in the history of the eleventh and twelfth centuries. But
to these I have added, especially on Domesday, so much which has
not yet seen the light, that the greater portion of the work is new,
while the rest has been in part re-written. The object I have set
before myself throughout is either to add to or correct our existing
knowledge of facts. And for this I have gone in the main to records,
whether in manuscript or in print. It is my hope that the papers in
this volume may further illustrate the value of such evidence as
supplementing and checking the chroniclers for what is still, in
many respects, an obscure period of our history.</p>

<p>As a foreign scholar has felicitously observed:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Je lis avec plaisir le chroniqueur qui nous raconte les &eacute;v&eacute;nements de son
&eacute;poque. Les d&eacute;tails anecdotiques, les traits piquants dont son &oelig;uvre est
pars&eacute;m&eacute;e font mes d&eacute;lices. Mais comment saurai-je s'il dit la v&eacute;rit&eacute; si les
pages qu'il me pr&eacute;sente ne sont pas un roman de pure imagination? Dans les
chartes, au contraire, tout est authentique, certain, pr&eacute;cis, indubitable. Leur
t&eacute;moignage est contradictoirement &eacute;tabli, sous le contr&ocirc;le de la partie adverse,
avec l'approbation et la reconaissance de l'autorit&eacute; souveraine, en
pr&eacute;sence d'une imposante assembl&eacute;e de notables qui apposent leur signature.
C'est la plus pure de toutes les sources o&ugrave; il soit possible de puiser un
renseignement historique.<a id="footnotetagp1" name="footnotetagp1"></a><a href="#footnotep1"><sup>1</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>An instance in point will be found in the paper on 'Richard the
First's change of seal'.</p>

<p>A collective title for a series of studies covering the period 1050-1200,
is not by any means easy to find. But dealing as they do so
largely with the origins of 'Feudal England', I have ventured to
give them this title, which may serve, I hope, to emphasize my point
that the feudal element introduced at the Conquest had a greater
influence on our national institutions than recent historians admit.<a id="footnotetagp2" name="footnotetagp2"></a><a href="#footnotep2"><sup>2</sup></a>
Even Domesday Book has its place in the study of feudalism, rearranging,
as it does, the Hundred and the Vill under Fiefs and
'Manors'.</p>

<p>To those in search of new light on our early mediaeval history,
I commend the first portion of this work, as setting forth, for their
careful consideration, views as evolutionary on the Domesday hide
and the whole system of land assessment as on the actual introduction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg 10]</span>
of the feudal system into England. Although I have here brought
into conjunction my discovery that the assessment of knight-service
was based on a five-knights unit, irrespective of area or value,
and my theory that the original assessment of land was based on a
five-hides unit, not calculated on area or value, yet the two, one
need hardly add, are, of course, unconnected. The one was an
Anglo-Saxon system, and, as I maintain, of early date; the other
was of Norman introduction, and of independent origin. My
theories were formed at different times, as the result of wholly
separate investigations. That of the five-hides unit was arrived at
several years ago, but was kept back in the hope that I might light
on some really satisfactory explanation of the phenomena presented.
The solution I now propound can only be deemed tentative. I
would hope, however, that the theories I advance may stimulate
others to approach the subject, and, above all, that they may
indicate to local students, in the future, the lines on which they
should work and the absolute need of their assistance.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important conclusion to which my researches
point is that Domesday reveals the existence of two separate systems
in England, co-extensive with two nationalities, the original <em>five
hides</em> of the 'Anglo-Saxon' in the south, and the later <em>six carucates</em>
of the 'Danish' invaders in the north.<a id="footnotetagp3" name="footnotetagp3"></a><a href="#footnotep3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>No one, I may add, is better qualified to carry further these
inquiries than Prof Maitland, whose brilliant pen has illumined for
us the origins of English law. Himself engaged on the study of
Domesday, he kindly offered to withhold his conclusions until my
work should have appeared.<a id="footnotetagp4" name="footnotetagp4"></a><a href="#footnotep4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>Among the fresh points here discussed in connection with Domesday
Book will be found the composition of the juries by whom the
returns were made, the origin and true character of the <cite>Inquisitio
Eliensis</cite>, and the marked difference of the two volumes compiled
from the Domesday returns.</p>

<p>Of the six early surveys dealt with in conjunction with Domesday,
I would call attention to that of Leicestershire as having, it
would seem, till now remained absolutely unknown. It has long been
a wish of mine to deal with these surveys,<a id="footnotetagp5" name="footnotetagp5"></a><a href="#footnotep5"><sup>5</sup></a> not only as belonging to a
period for which we have no records, but also as illustrating Domesday
Book. In 'The Knights of Peterborough' will be found some
facts relating to Hereward 'the Wake', which seem to have eluded
Mr Freeman's investigations, and even those of Mr Tout.</p>

<p>In case it should suggest itself that these papers, and some in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg 11]</span>
other portion of the work dwell at undue length on unimportant
points, I would observe that apart from the fact that even small
points acquire a relative importance from our scanty knowledge of
the time, there are cases in which their careful investigation may
lead to unforeseen results. At the last anniversary of the Royal
Society, Lord Kelvin quoted these words from his own presidential
address in 1871:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Accurate and minute measurement seems to the non-scientific imagination
a less lofty and dignified work than looking for something new. But
nearly all the grandest discoveries of science have been but the rewards of
accurate measurement and patient, long continued labour in the minute
sifting of numerical results.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The same principle applies to the study of institutional history.
Whether we are dealing with military service, with the land, with
finance, or with the king's court, 'the minute sifting' of facts and
figures is the only sure method by which we can extend knowledge.</p>

<p>To those who know how few are the original authorities for the
period, and how diligently these have been explored and their
information exhausted, the wonder will be not so much that there is
little, as that there was anything at all yet left to discover.</p>

<p class="spaceabove">In a work dealing with the history of the eleventh and twelfth
centuries, a writer must inevitably find himself at times dealing
with the same subjects as the late Professor Freeman. Without in
any way disparaging the genius of that eminent man, one may deem
it a duty to correct the errors into which he fell, and conscientiously
to combat, as an obstinate and mischievous superstition, the conviction
of his pre-eminent accuracy and authority on matters of
fact. It would be far pleasanter to dwell only on his merits; but when
one finds that, in spite of the proofs I have been producing for years,
Mr Herbert Fisher, representing the Oxford school of history, can
still declare Mr Freeman to have reached 'the highest standard of
scholarly exactitude',<a id="footnotetagp6" name="footnotetagp6"></a><a href="#footnotep6"><sup>6</sup></a> it is evident that the works of the Regius
Professor are still surrounded by a false glamour, and that one
must further expose his grave liability to error. I cannot suppose
that any competent scholar who may carefully peruse this work
will in future venture to deny that, in spite of his many and his
splendid gifts, Mr Freeman was as liable as any of us to error, or that
however laudable his intentions, he was capable of precisely the
same inaccuracy and occasionally of the same confusion as he
denounced so bitterly in others.</p>

<p>It is, indeed, my contention, as I have already explained,<a id="footnotetagp7" name="footnotetagp7"></a><a href="#footnotep7"><sup>7</sup></a>
that to these denunciations of the errors of others is largely due the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg 12]</span>
conviction of Mr Freeman's supreme accuracy. The question raised
may seem to affect the whole method of history, for if, as has been
said, it is the argument of the scientific historian that we ought to
prefer accuracy of fact to charm of presentment and to literary
style, the proof that his method fails to save him from erring like any
'literary' historian strikes at the root of his whole contention.</p>

<p>Yet it is not the scientific method, but its prophet himself that was
at fault.</p>

<p>Although I am here only concerned with inaccuracy in matters
of fact, I would guard myself against the retort that, at least, Mr
Freeman's errors are of little consequence as compared with that
obliquity of vision which led Mr Froude, at all hazards, to vindicate
Henry the Eighth. Without insisting on an absolute parallel, I
trace a resemblance even here. Just as his bias against the Roman
church led Mr Froude to vindicate Henry in order to justify the
breach with Rome, so Mr Freeman's passion for democracy made
him an advocate on behalf of Harold, as 'one whose claim was not
drawn only from the winding-sheet of his fathers'. I have elsewhere
maintained, as to Harold's election 'by the free choice of a free
people', that Mr Freeman's undoubted perversion of the case at
this 'the central point' of his history, gravely impairs his narrative of
the Conquest, because its success, and even its undertaking, can
actually be traced to that election.<a id="footnotetagp8" name="footnotetagp8"></a><a href="#footnotep8"><sup>8</sup></a> Unless we realize its disastrous
effect on the situation both at home and abroad, we cannot rightly
understand the triumph of the Duke's enterprise.</p>

<p>It had been my hope, in the present work, to have avoided
acute controversy, but the attitude adopted, unfortunately, by the
late Professor's champions has rendered that course impossible.
One can but rejoice that his accuracy should find strenuous defenders,
as it removes the reluctance one would otherwise feel in continuing
to criticize it now. A case is doubly proved when proved in
the teeth of opposition. But one expects that opposition to be fair,
and the line my opponents have taken throughout cannot, by any
stretch of courtesy, be so described. My difficulty, indeed, in dealing
with their arguments on the Battle of Hastings, is that they do not
affect or even touch my case. In spite of their persistent efforts to
obscure a plain issue, there is not, and there cannot be, any 'controversy'
as to Mr Freeman and the 'palisade'. For, while fully
recognizing that the <i>onus probandi</i> lay on those who assert its existence,
he failed, on his own showing, to produce any proof of it whatever.<a id="footnotetagp9" name="footnotetagp9"></a><a href="#footnotep9"><sup>9</sup></a>
Mr Archer has ended,<a id="footnotetagp10" name="footnotetagp10"></a><a href="#footnotep10"><sup>10</sup></a> as he
began,<a id="footnotetagp11" name="footnotetagp11"></a><a href="#footnotep11"><sup>11</sup></a> by deliberately ignoring Mr
Freeman's words,<a id="footnotetagp12" name="footnotetagp12"></a><a href="#footnotep12"><sup>12</sup></a> on which my case avowedly rests, and without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg 13]</span>
suppressing which he could not even enter the field. This, indeed, I
have explained so often, that I need not again have disposed of his
arguments had not Mr Gardiner, in the exercise of his editorial
discretion, allowed him to make certain statements,<a id="footnotetagp13" name="footnotetagp13"></a><a href="#footnotep13"><sup>13</sup></a> and refused
me the right of exposing them. A typical example will be found on
p. 273.<a id="footnotetagp14" name="footnotetagp14"></a><a href="#footnotep14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>It is not only demonstrable error that justifies critical treatment;
no less dangerous, if not more so, is that subtle commixture of guess-work
and fact, which leaves us in doubt as to what is proved and
what is merely hypothesis. In his lecture on 'The Nature of Historical
Evidence', the late Professor himself well brought out the point:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Many people seem to think that a position is proved if it can not be disproved....
Very few see with Sir George Lewis&mdash;though Sir George Lewis
perhaps carried his own doctrine a little too far&mdash;that in a great many cases
we ought to be satisfied with a negative result, that we must often put up
with knowing that a thing did not happen in a particular way, or did not
happen at all, without being furnished with any counter-statement to put in
the place of that which we reject.<a id="footnotetagp15" name="footnotetagp15"></a><a href="#footnotep15"><sup>15</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>The question is whether a statement can be proved, not whether
it can be disproved. Cases in point will be found on pp. 291, 298,
331-3.</p>

<p>It may, in view of certain comments, be desirable, perhaps, to
explain that the study on the origin of knight-service appeared in Mr
Freeman's lifetime,<a id="footnotetagp16" name="footnotetagp16"></a><a href="#footnotep16"><sup>16</sup></a> and that my open criticism of his work began
so far back as 1882. It will be seen, therefore, that I challenged its
accuracy when he was himself able to reply.</p>

<p>To those who may hold that in these studies excessive attention is
bestowed on Anglo-Norman genealogy, I commend the words, not
of a genealogist, but of the historian Kemble:</p>

<blockquote><p>
It is indispensable to a clear view of the constitutional law and governmental
institutions of this country, that we should not lose sight of the
distribution of landed estates among the great families, and that the rise and
fall of these houses should be carefully traced and steadily borne in mind....</p>

<p>Amidst all the tumult and confusions of civil and foreign wars; throughout
religious and political revolutions; from the days of Arminius to those of
Harald; from the days of Harald to our own; the successions of the landowners
and the relations arising out of these successions, are the running
comment upon the events in our national history: they are at once the causes
and the criteria of facts, and upon them has depended the development and
settlement of principles, in laws which still survive, in institutions which we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg 14]</span>
cling to with reverence, in feelings which make up the complex of our
national character.<a id="footnotetagp17" name="footnotetagp17"></a><a href="#footnotep17"><sup>17</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>The paper on 'Walter Tirel and his wife' may serve to show that in
this department there is still needed much labour before we can
hope for a perfect record of the great houses of the Conquest.</p>

<p class="spaceabove">I have to thank Mr Murray for his kind permission to make use
of two of the articles I have contributed to the <cite>Quarterly Review.</cite>.
Some of the studies have previously appeared in the <cite>English Historical
Review</cite>, and these are now republished with Messrs Longmans'
consent. Lastly, I would take the opportunity afforded by this
preface of acknowledging the encouragement my researches have
derived from the approval not only of our supreme authority&mdash;I
mean the Bishop of Oxford&mdash;but also of that eminent scholar, Dr
Liebermann, whose name one is proud to associate with a work on
mediaeval history.</p>

<h2>PART I<br /><br />

TERRITORIAL STUDIES</h2>

<h3>DOMESDAY BOOK</h3>

<p>The true key to the Domesday Survey, and to the system of land
assessment it records, is found in the <cite>Inquisitio Comitatus
Cantabrigiensis</cite>.
Although the document so styled is one of cardinal importance, it
has, from accident, been known to few, and has consequently
never succeeded in obtaining the attention and scientific treatment
it deserved. The merit of its identification belongs to Mr Philip
Carteret Webb, who published in 1756 a paper originally read
before the Society of Antiquaries, entitled, <cite>A Short Account of Danegeld,
with some further particulars relating to William the Conqueror's Survey</cite>. It is
difficult to speak too highly of this production, remembering the
date at which it was composed. Many years were yet to elapse before
the printing of Domesday was even begun, and historical evidences
were largely inaccessible as compared with the condition of things
today. Yet the ability shown by Mr Webb in this careful and conscientious
piece of work is well seen in his interesting discovery,
which he announced in these words:</p>

<blockquote><p>
In searching for the <cite>Liber Eliensis</cite>, I have had the good fortune to discover
in the Cotton Library a MS. copy of the Inquisition of the jury, containing
their survey for most of the hundreds in Cambridgeshire. This MS. is
written on vellum in double columns and on both sides of the page. It is
bound up with the <cite>Liber Eliensis</cite>, and begins at p. 76<i>a</i> and ends at p. 113. It is
written in a very fair but ancient character, not coeval with the Survey, but
of about the time of Henry II. It was given by Mr Arthur Agard to Sir
Robert Cotton, and is marked Tiberius A. VI 4. Your lordship and the
Society will be of opinion that this is a discovery of importance, and what had
escaped the observation of Sir H. Spelman, Mr Selden, and other antiquarians.
A part of this valuable morsel of antiquity is already transcribed,
and in a few weeks I hope to be able to communicate the whole of it to the
Society (p. 26).
</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr Webb's discovery was known to Kelham, and duly referred
to by him in his <cite>Domesday Book Illustrated</cite> (1788). It was also known to
Sir Francis Palgrave, strong in his acquaintance with manuscript
authorities, who alluded (1832) to the fact that 'fragments of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg 18]</span>
original inquisitions have been preserved',<a id="footnotetagid1" name="footnotetagid1"></a><a href="#footnoteid1"><sup>1</sup></a> and described the MS.
Tib. A. VI, of which 'the first portion consists of the <cite>Inquisitio
Eliensis</cite>, extending, as above mentioned, into five counties; it is
followed by the inedited <cite>Inquisitio</cite>', etc.<a id="footnotetagid2" name="footnotetagid2"></a><a href="#footnoteid2"><sup>2</sup></a> It is, however, undoubtedly
ignored in Ellis's <cite>Introduction to Domesday Book</cite> (1833), and 'even
the indefatigable Sir Thomas Duffus Hardy', writes Mr Birch,<a id="footnotetagid3" name="footnotetagid3"></a><a href="#footnoteid3"><sup>3</sup></a>
'has omitted all notice of this manuscript in his <cite>Descriptive Catalogue
of Manuscripts relating to the History of Great Britain and Ireland</cite>, vol.
ii.
(1865)'. This, however, is not strictly the case, for in his notice of
the Domesday MSS. he observes in a footnoteid:</p>

<blockquote><p>
The Cottonian MS. [Tib. A. VI] has also a second and unique portion of
this survey, which was not printed in the edition published by the Record
Commission in 1816. It commences 'in Grantebriggesira, in Staplehouhund',
and ends imperfectly 'et vicecomiti regis v. auras'.
</p></blockquote>

<p>These words prove that Sir Thomas had inspected the MS., which
duly begins and ends with the words here given.</p>

<p>It is certain, however, that Mr Freeman, most ardent of Domesday
students, knew nothing of this precious evidence, and remained
therefore virtually unacquainted with the <i>modus operandi</i> of the
Great Survey. The pages, we shall find, of the <cite>Inquisitio</cite> afford
information that no one would have welcomed more eagerly than
himself. Perhaps, therefore, it is not surprising that Mr N. E. S. A.
Hamilton, when editing this document for the Royal Society of
Literature (1876), should have supposed that it had been overlooked
till then, or that he was 'the first to bring its importance to light'
(p. vi). It is, however, much to be regretted that Mr De Gray Birch
should have strenuously insisted that Webb (whose paper he
actually names) and Kelham 'appear to have been strangely ignorant
of the true and important nature of this manuscript',<a id="footnotetagid4" name="footnotetagid4"></a><a href="#footnoteid4"><sup>4</sup></a> and should
have repeated this assertion<a id="footnotetagid5" name="footnotetagid5"></a><a href="#footnoteid5"><sup>5</sup></a> after I had shown at the Domesday
Commemoration (1886) that the honour of the discovery really
belonged to Mr P. C. Webb. One may claim that Webb should
have his due, while gladly expressing gratitude to Mr Hamilton
for his noble edition of the <cite>Inquisitio</cite>, which has conferred on Domesday
students an inestimable boon.<a id="footnotetagid6" name="footnotetagid6"></a><a href="#footnoteid6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>The printing of the document in record type, the collation
throughout with Domesday Book, and the appending of the
<cite>Inquisitio Eliensis</cite>, edited from three different texts, represent an
extraordinary amount of minute and wearisome labour. The result
is a volume as helpful as it is indispensable to the scholar.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg 19]</span></p>

<p>I propose in this paper to take up anew the subject, at the point
where Mr Hamilton has left it, to submit the text to scientific
criticism, to assign it its weight in the scale of authority, and to
explain its glossarial and its illustrative value for the construction
and the contents of Domesday Book.</p>

<h4>I. NATURE OF THE 'INQ. COM. CANT.'<a name="page19a" id="page19a"></a></h4>

<p>Exact definition is needful at the outset in dealing with this document.
The <cite>Inquisitio Comitatus Cantabrigiensi</cite>, which is entered on fos.
76-113 of Tib. A. VI, must be carefully distinguished from the
<cite>Inquisitio Eliensis</cite> on fos. 38-68. Mr Hamilton doubted whether any
one before him 'had distinguished between' the two, but this, we
have seen, was a mistake. The distinction however is all-important,
the two documents differing altogether in character. One
would not think it necessary to distinguish them also from the so-called
<cite>Liber Eliensis</cite> (which is not a survey at all) had not Mr Eyton
inadvertently stated that our document has been printed under the
title of <cite>Liber Eliensis</cite>.<a id="footnotetagid7" name="footnotetagid7"></a><a href="#footnoteid7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>The <cite>Inquisitio Comitatus Cantabrigiensi</cite> (hereafter styled 'the I.C.C.')
deals with the county of Cambridge alone, but, in that county, with
the lands of all holders. The <cite>Inquisitio Eliensis</cite> (which I propose to
style 'the I.E.') deals with several counties, but, in these counties,
with the lands of the abbey alone. The latter was duly printed, with
Domesday Book, by the Record Commission; the former remained
in manuscript till printed by Mr Hamilton.</p>

<p>Mr Hamilton describes his record at the outset as 'the Original
Return made by the <i>Juratores</i> of the county of Cambridge in obedience
to the Conqueror's mandate, from which the Exchequer
Domesday for that county was afterwards compiled by the King's
secretaries', and as 'the original source from which the Exchequer
Domesday for that county was derived'. Mr Birch here again repeats
the words, insisting 'that we have in this very precious Cottonian
MS. <em>the original source</em> from which the Exchequer Domesday of
Cambridgeshire was compiled'.<a id="footnotetagid8" name="footnotetagid8"></a><a href="#footnoteid8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>Such a description is most unfortunate being not only inaccurate
but misleading. All that we are entitled to predicate of the document
is that it is <em>apparently a copy</em> of the original returns from which
Domesday Book was compiled. For 'the original source' of both we
must look to the now missing returns of the jurors, the primary
authority from which Domesday Book and the <cite>Inquisitio Com. Cant.</cite>
are independently derived. This distinction is all-important, reducing,
as it does, the <cite>Inquisitio</cite> from the rank of an 'original' to that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg 20]</span>
of a secondary authority on the same level with Domesday Book.<a id="footnotetagid9" name="footnotetagid9"></a><a href="#footnoteid9"><sup>9</sup></a>
Mr Hamilton, like Mr Webb before him, assigned the handwriting
of the <cite>Inquisitio</cite> to about the close of the twelfth century.
The copy of the returns which it contains, therefore, was made about
a century later than the returns themselves.</p>

<p>The problem then that we have to solve is this: 'Is the I.C.C.
an actual transcript of these original returns, and if so, is it faithful?'
I will not, like Mr Hamilton, assume an affirmative, but will
attempt an impartial inquiry.</p>

<p>The two paths which we must follow in turn to arrive at a just
conclusion are (1) the construction of the I.C.C., (2) collation with
the <cite>Inq. Eliensis</cite>. For I hope to show that the latter record must have
been derived from the same source as the <cite>Inq. Com. Cant.</cite></p>

<p>Following the first of these paths, we note at once that while
<cite>Domesday Book</cite> arranges the Manors according to fiefs, the <cite>Inq. Com.
Cant.</cite>, on the contrary, arranges them by hundreds and townships.
Its system is regular and simple. For every hundred it first enumerates
the principal jurors who made the return, and then gives the
return itself, arranged according to townships (<i>vill&aelig;</i>). These townships
are thus the units of which the Manors they contain are
merely the component fractions. This is precisely what we should
expect to find in the original returns, but it only creates a presumption;
it does not afford a proof. For instance, it might be reasonably
urged that these copies may have omitted certain items in
the returns, just as Domesday Book omitted others.</p>

<p>To reply to this objection, we must turn to the second path;
that is to say, we must collate the <cite>Inquisitio Eliensis</cite> with the <cite>Inq.
Com. Cant.</cite> I shall prove below that the latter cannot have been taken
from the former, which only covers a portion of its field, and that, on
the other hand, the former cannot have been taken from the latter,
because the <cite>Inquisitio Eliensis</cite> is accurate in places where the <cite>Inq.
Com. Cant.</cite> is in error. Consequently they must both have been
derived independently from some third document. This being so,
if we should find that their versions agree closely, we may fairly
infer that each is intended to be a faithful reproduction of the above
'third document'. In other words, if neither version omits items
which are given in the other, we are entitled to assume that the
copy is in each case exhaustive, for two scribes working independently
are not likely to have systematically omitted the same items
from the document before them.</p>

<p>What then was the 'third document' from which they both
copied? Obviously it was either the original returns of the Domesday
jurors, or a copy (exhaustive or not) of these returns. Now we
cannot suppose that two scribes, working, as I have said, independently,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg 21]</span>
would both have worked, not from the original returns
themselves, but from a copy, and that the same copy of these returns&mdash;a
copy, moreover, of the existence of which we have no evidence
whatever. Moreover, in this hypothetical copy, there would, we
may safely assert, have been some clerical errors. These would have
duly re-appeared in both the <cite>Inquisitiones</cite>, and collation with
Domesday Book would enable us to detect them. Yet in no single
instance, though each of them contains errors, have I found a
clerical error common to both. We are thus driven to the conclusion
that in both these <cite>Inquisitiones</cite> we have copies of the actual
returns made by the Domesday jurors.</p>

<p>One of the postulates in the above argument is that the <cite>Inq. Com.
Cant.</cite> and the <cite>Inq. Eliensis</cite> 'agree closely' in their versions. Here is an
instance in illustration:<a id="footnotetagid10" name="footnotetagid10"></a><a href="#footnoteid10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>These extracts are typical and instructive. They leave, in the
first place, no doubt upon the mind that both are versions of the
same original. This, which proves my postulate, will be shown
below to possess a further and important bearing. But while these
versions closely agree, we notice (1) independent blunders, (2) slight
variants in diction. As to blunders, we see that the I.C.C. has
'sol[idis]' where the I.E. has the correct 'hidis', while, conversely,
the I.E. reads 'hun[dredis]' where the I.C.C. has, rightly, 'hidis'.
Again the I.C.C. allots to demesne an assessment of a hide and a
virgate, but I.E. a hide and a half (<i>i.e</i>. two virgates). Collation with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg 22]</span>
Domesday Book confirms the former version. Conversely, the I.C.C.
assigns to the mill the value of three shillings and eightpence, but
the I.E. of two shillings and eightpence. Collation with Domesday
Book confirms the latter. Turning now to the variants, we may
express them more clearly thus:</p>

<p>These prove that verbal accuracy was not aimed at by the transcribers.
The same freedom from its trammels is seen in the transposition
of the 'mill' and 'meadow' passages, and, indeed, in the
highly abbreviated form of the I.E. entries (in which a single letter,
mostly, does duty for a word), which shows that the original version
must have been either extended in the I.C.C., or (more probably)
abbreviated in the I.E.</p>

<p>We are now in a position to advance to the criticism of the text of
the <cite>Inq. Com. Cant.</cite>, and to inquire how far it can be trusted as a
reproduction of the original returns. In other words, are its contents
more or less trustworthy than those of Domesday Book?</p>

<p>It might, no doubt, be fairly presumed that a simple transcript
of the original returns was less likely to contain error than such a
compilation as Domesday Book, in which their contents were (1) rearranged
on a different system, (2) epitomized and partly omitted,
(3) altered in wording. Mr Hamilton, indeed, who was naturally
tempted to make the most of his MS., appears to have jumped at
this conclusion; for he speaks in his preface (p. xii) of its 'superior
exactness', and gives us no hint of omissions or of blunders. There are,
however, plenty of both, as will be seen from the lists below, which
do not profess to be exhaustive.</p>

<p>But we will first examine the instances adduced by Mr Hamilton.
Out of ten examples in proof of its value, five are cases in which
'the want of precision in Domesday' leaves the identity of the
tenant-in-chief 'undefined'. It is difficult to comment on these
statements, because in all five cases the name is as carefully recorded
in Domesday as in the I.C.C. Mr Hamilton's error can only, it will
be found, have arisen from comparing the I.C.C. not with Domesday
Book, but with the extracts therefrom printed in his work,
which, being torn from their place, do not, of course, contain the
tenant's full name, which in Domesday itself is given at the head of
the list from which they are taken. Moreover, as it happens, this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg 23]</span>
test demonstrates not the inferiority, but (in one instance at least)
the superiority of Domesday, the I.C.C. (fo. 97, col. 2) reading
'Hanc terram tenuit comes alanus' [<i>sic</i>], where Domesday has
(rightly) 'Hanc terram tenuit Algar comes'. The former must have
wrongly extended the abbreviated original entry.<a id="footnotetagid11" name="footnotetagid11"></a><a href="#footnoteid11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p>Another of Mr Hamilton's examples is this:</p>

<blockquote><p>
'H&aelig;c terra fuit et est de dominio &aelig;cclesi&aelig;' (Domesday) is abbreviated
from a long account of the holdings of Harduuinus de Scalariis and Turcus
homo abbatis de Rameseio in the Cotton MS.
</p></blockquote>

<p>But, on referring to the passage in question, we find that the
Domesday passage: 'H&aelig;c terra fuit et est de dominio &aelig;cclesi&aelig;'
has nothing to do with that 'long account', but corresponds to the
simple formula in the I.C.C., 'Hanc terram tenuerunt monache de
cet'ero T.R.E. et modo tenent'. The example which follows it is
this:</p>

<blockquote><p>
At pp. 38, 39 we see a curious alteration in the value of the land, which
had risen from xv. lib. 'quando recepit' and T.R.E. to xvii. lib. at the time
the return was made, and dropped again to xvi. lib. in the Domesday Survey.
</p></blockquote>

<p>This strange comment implies the supposition that the I.C.C.
records an earlier survey than Domesday Book, whereas, of course,
they are derived from the same returns, so that the discrepancy of
xvi. and xvii. is merely a clerical error. One more instance, the
'curious reading' <i>Harlestone</i> in the I.C.C., is shown below to be
merely an error in that MS. Such are eight of the examples adduced
by Mr Hamilton. The remaining two merely illustrate not the
superior accuracy, but the greater elaboration of the I.C.C. It
has been absolutely necessary to dispose of these examples, in order
to show that a critical estimate of the value of the I.C.C. has yet to
be made.</p>

<p>Taking the omissions in the MS. first, we find some really bad
ones. On fo. 79<span class="sc">a</span> (2), collation with Domesday gives this result:</p>

<p>In all these three cases the italicized words are misplaced, and in
all three the explanation is the same, the scribe having first omitted
them, and then inserted them later out of place. Having now criticized
the text of the I.C.C., and shown that it presents no small
traces of unintelligent clerkship, if not of actual ignorance of the
terms and <i>formul&aelig;</i> of Domesday, I turn to the text of Domesday
Book, to test it by comparison with that of the I.C.C.</p>

<h4>II. CRITICISM OF THE DOMESDAY TEXT<a name="page26a" id="page26a"></a></h4>

<p>Among the omissions are, on i, 195 (<i>b</i>) 1, 'Item et reddebat viii.
den. vel aueram si rex in vicecomitatu venit' (p. 5). At Kirtling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg 27]</span>
(p. 11), 'et v<sup>ta.</sup> caruca potest fieri [in dominio]' is omitted (i. 202
<i>a</i>).
So is (p. 25) a potential demesne plough of John fitz Waleran
(i. 201 <i>b</i>). The Countess Judith's sokemen at Carlton (pp. 20, 21)
have their values omitted<a id="footnotetagid25" name="footnotetagid25"></a><a href="#footnoteid25"><sup>25</sup></a> (i. 202, <i>a</i>, 2).
'Habuerunt dimidiam
hidam, et,' is omitted (p. 28) in the entry of two sokemen of Godwine
(201, <i>b</i>, 2). On i. 196 (<i>a</i>) 1, 'Terra est i. bovi' is wanting (p.
79).
More important, however, are the omissions of whole entries. These
are by no means difficult to account for, the process of extracting
from the original returns, the various entries relating to each
particular fief being one which was almost certain to result in such
omissions.<a id="footnotetagid26" name="footnotetagid26"></a><a href="#footnoteid26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

<p>Moreover, two entries were occasionally thrown into one, a
dangerous plan for the clerks themselves, and one which may
sometimes lead us to think that an entry is omitted when it is duly
to be found under another head. Lastly, the compilers of Domesday
Book had no such invaluable check for their work as was afforded in
the original by entering first the assessment of the whole township,
and then that of each of its component Manors separately. But of this
more below.<a id="footnotetagid27" name="footnotetagid27"></a><a href="#footnoteid27"><sup>27</sup></a>
The only wonder is that the omissions are, after all,
so few. Perhaps even of these some may be only apparent. Hardwin's
half-hide in <i>Burwell</i> (p. 6) is wanting; so is Aubrey's half-virgate in
<i>Badburgham</i>, according to Mr Hamilton (p. 36), but the oversight is
his. A virgate held in Trumpington by a burgess of Cambridge (p.
51) would seem to be not forthcoming, but its position was somewhat
anomalous.<a id="footnotetagid28" name="footnotetagid28"></a><a href="#footnoteid28"><sup>28</sup></a>
Guy de Rembercurt held a hide and a virgate in
<i>Haslingefield</i> (p. 73), though we cannot find it in Domesday; and in
<i>Witewelle</i> (Outwell) two hides which were held by Robert, a tenant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg 28]</span>
of Hardwin (p. 81), are similarly omitted, according to Mr Hamilton
but will be found under 'Wateuuelle' (198, <i>b</i>, 2).</p>

<p>There are cases in which the I.C.C. corrects D.B., cases in which
D.B. corrects the I.C.C., and cases in which the I.C.C. corrects
itself. There are also several cases of discrepancy between the two,
in which we cannot positively pronounce which, if either, is right. A
singular instance of both being wrong is found in the case of Soham.
The assessment of this township was actually eleven hides, its four
component holdings being severally assessed at nine and a half
hides less six acres, half a hide, one hide, and six acres. The I.C.C.
at first gives the total assessment as eleven hides and a half, while
D.B. erroneously assesses the first of the four holdings at six hides and
forty acres in one place, and nine hides and a half in the other,
both figures being wrong. A most remarkable case of yet another
kind is found in <i>Scelford</i> (Shelford). Here the entry in I.C.C. agrees
exactly with the duplicate entries found in D.B. Yet they both make
nonsense.<a id="footnotetagid29" name="footnotetagid29"></a><a href="#footnoteid29"><sup>29</sup></a>
But on turning to the <cite>Inquisitio Eliensis</cite> we obtain the
correct version. As this is a very important and probably unique
instance, the entries are here given in parallel columns:</p>

<p>Here the <cite>Inquisitio Eliensis</cite> version shows us that the estate had two
divisions held by different tenures. Three virgates the sokemen were
not free to sell; the other three they might sell, but if they did,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg 29]</span>
'predictus abbas semper socham habuit'.<a id="footnotetagid31" name="footnotetagid31"></a><a href="#footnoteid31"><sup>31</sup></a>
The two divisions of the
estate are confused in the other versions. But all three of these
correspond so exactly that we are driven to assign the error to the
original returns themselves. In that case the compiler (or compilers)
of the I.E. will have corrected the original return from his own
knowledge of the facts, which knowledge, I shall show, he certainly
possessed.</p>

<p>This brings us to the <i>errors</i> of Domesday. For comparison's sake, I
here tabulate them like those of the I.C.C.:</p>

<p>Comparing the omissions and errors, as a whole, in these two
versions of the original returns, it may be said that the comparison
is in favour of the Domesday Book text, although, from the process
of its compilation, it was far the most exposed to error. No one who
has not analysed and collated such texts for himself can realize the
extreme difficulty of avoiding occasional error. The abbreviations
and the <i>formul&aelig;</i> employed in these surveys are so many pitfalls for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg 30]</span>
the transcriber, and the use of Roman numerals is almost fatal to
accuracy. The insertion or omission of an 'x' or an 'i' was probably
the cause of half the errors of which the Domesday scribes were
guilty. Remembering that they had, in Mr Eyton's words,<a id="footnotetagid34" name="footnotetagid34"></a><a href="#footnoteid34"><sup>34</sup></a>
to perform 'a task, not of mere manual labour and imitative accuracy,
but a task requiring intellect&mdash;intellect, clear, well-balanced,
apprehensive, comprehensive, and trained withal', we can really
only wonder that they performed it so well as they did.</p>

<p>Still, the fact remains that on a few pages of Domesday we have
been able to detect a considerable number of inaccuracies and
omissions. The sacrosanct status of the Great Survey is thus gravely
modified. I desire to lay stress on this fact, which is worthy of the
labour it has cost to establish. For two important conclusions follow.
Firstly, it is neither safe nor legitimate to make general inferences
from a single entry in Domesday. All conclusions as to the interpretation
of its <i>formulae</i> should be based on <i>data</i> sufficiently numerous
to exclude the influence of error. Secondly, if we find that a rule of
interpretation can be established in an overwhelming majority of the
cases examined, we are justified, conversely, in claiming that the
apparent exceptions may be due to errors in the text.</p>

<p>The first of these conclusions has a special bearing on the theories
propounded by Mr Pell with so much ingenuity and learning.<a id="footnotetagid35" name="footnotetagid35"></a><a href="#footnoteid35"><sup>35</sup></a>
I have shown, in an essay criticizing these theories,<a id="footnotetagid36" name="footnotetagid36"></a><a href="#footnoteid36"><sup>36</sup></a> that the
case of Clifton, to which Mr Pell attached so much importance,<a id="footnotetagid37" name="footnotetagid37"></a><a href="#footnoteid37"><sup>37</sup></a>
is nothing, in all probability, but one of Domesday's blunders, of
which I gave, in that essay, other instances. So, too, in the case of his
own Manor of Wilburton, Mr Pell accepted without question the
reading '<em>six</em> ploughlands', as representing the 'primary return',<a id="footnotetagid38" name="footnotetagid38"></a><a href="#footnoteid38"><sup>38</sup></a>
although that reading is only found in the most corrupt of the
three versions of the <cite>Inquisitio Eliensis</cite>, while the two better versions
(B and C texts) agree with Domesday Book, and with the abbreviated
return at the end of the A text itself (Tib. A. VI fo. 67, <i>b</i>, 1), in
giving the ploughlands as <em>seven</em>. Really it is nothing but waste of
time to argue from a reading which is only found in one out of five
MSS., and that one the most corrupt.</p>

<p>This brings me to the existence and the value of duplicate entries in
Domesday. Mr Hamilton describes as 'a curious reading' the words
in the I.C.C., 'sed soca remanebat <i>Harlestone</i>'. Now it so happens
that in this case we have five separate versions of the original
entry: one in the I.C.C., one in the I.E., and three in Domesday
Book. Here they are side by side:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg 31]</span></p>

</table>

<p>The value of such collation as this ought to be self-evident. It is
not only that we thus find four out of five MSS. to be against the
reading '<i>Harlestone</i>' (which, indeed, to any one familiar with the
survey is obviously a clerical error), but that here and elsewhere we
are thus afforded what might almost be termed a bilingual inscription.
We learn, for instance, that the Domesday scribe deemed it
quite immaterial whether he wrote 'recedere cum terra ejus', or
'vendere' or 'recedere sine licentia'. Consequently, these phrases
were all identical in meaning.<a id="footnotetagid39" name="footnotetagid39"></a><a href="#footnoteid39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>

<p>Considerable light is thrown by the I.C.C. on the origin of these
little known duplicate entries in Domesday. In every instance of
their occurrence within the limits of its province they are due to a
conflict of title recorded in the original return. They appear further
to be confined to the estates of two landowners, Picot, the sheriff,
and Hardwin d'Eschalers, the titles of both being frequently contested
by the injured Abbot of Ely. Why the third local offender,
Guy de Raimbercurt, does not similarly appear, it is difficult to
say. He was the smallest offender of the three, and Picot the worst;
but it is Hardwin's name which occurs most frequently in these
duplicate entries.<a id="footnotetagid40" name="footnotetagid40"></a><a href="#footnoteid40"><sup>40</sup></a>
The principle which guided the Domesday
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg 32]</span>
scribes cannot be certainly decided, for they duplicated entries in the
original return which (according to the I.C.C.) varied greatly in
their statements of tenure. Thus, to take the first three:</p>

<p>Here, whether the original return states Hardwin to hold (1) of
the abbot, (2) of the king, or (3) of neither, the scribes, in each of
the three cases, enter the estates (<i>A</i>) under the Abbot's land, as
held of the Abbot, (<i>B</i>) under Hardwin's land, as held <i>in capite</i>.
And
it is singular that in all these three cases the entry of the estate under
the Abbot's land is the fuller of the two.<a id="footnotetagid42" name="footnotetagid42"></a><a href="#footnoteid42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>

<p>On the whole it would appear that the Domesday scribes did not
consistently carry out a system of duplicate entry, though, on the
other hand, these entries were by no means due to mere clerical
inadvertence, but were prompted by a doubt as to the title, which
led to the precaution of entering them under the names of both the
claimants.</p>

<p>But the chief point of interest in these same entries is that they
give us, when we add the versions of the I.C.C. and the I.E., four
parallel texts. At some of the results of their collation we will now
glance.</p>

<p>No one can glance at these passages without perceiving that <i>dare</i>,
<i>vendere</i>, and <i>recedere</i> are all interchangeably used, and that even
any
two of them (whether they have the conjunction 'et' or the disjunction
'vel' between them) are identical with any one. It would be
possible to collect almost any number of instances in point. Further,
the insertion or omission of the phrase 'sine' (or 'absque') 'ejus
licentia' is immaterial, it being understood where not expressed.
So too with the words 'cui voluit'. In short, like the translators to
whom we owe the Authorized Version, the Domesday scribes
appear to have revelled in the use of synonym and paraphrase.<a id="footnotetagid44" name="footnotetagid44"></a><a href="#footnoteid44"><sup>44</sup></a>
Our own conceptions of the sacredness of a text and of the need for
verbal accuracy were evidently foreign to their minds.</p>

<p>Glancing for a moment at another county, we have in the
Survey of Leicestershire a remarkable instance of a whole fief
being entered twice over. It is that of Robert Hostiarius:</p>

<p>Here the last two entries (both relating to Claxton) have been
boldly thrown into one in the second version, which also (though
omitting the number of ploughlands) gives additional information
in the name of Robert's father, and in those of his predecessors
T.R.E. This is thus an excellent illustration of the liberty allowed
themselves by the compilers of Domesday.</p>

<p>An instance on a smaller scale is found in the Survey of Cambridgeshire,
where we read on opposite pages:</p>

<h4>III. 'SOCA' AND 'THEINLAND'<a name="page35a" id="page35a"></a></h4>

<p>The extracts I have given above establish beyond a doubt the
existence among the 'sochemanni' of two kinds of tenure. We have
(1) those who were free to part with (<i>vendere</i>) and leave
(<i>recedere</i>)
their land, (2) those who were not, i.e. who could not do so without
the abbot's licence. This distinction is reproduced in two terms
which I will now examine.</p>

<p>In the <cite>Inquisitio Eliensis</cite> and the documents connected with it
there is much mention of the 'thegnlands' of the Abbey. These
lands are specially distinguished from 'sokeland' (<i>terra de soca</i>).
Both, of course, are distinct from the 'dominium'. Thus in one of the
Conqueror's writs we read:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Restituantur ecclesi&aelig; terr&aelig; que in <i>dominio</i> suo erant die obitus &AElig;duardi....
Qui autem tenent <i>theinlandes</i> que procul dubio debent teneri de ecclesia
faciant concordiam cum abbate quam meliorem poterint,... Hoc quoque
de tenentibus <i>socam</i> et <i>sacam</i> fiat.<a id="footnotetagid46" name="footnotetagid46"></a><a href="#footnoteid46"><sup>46</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Now this distinction between 'thegnland' and 'sokeland' will be
found to fit in exactly with the difference in tenure we have examined
above. Here is an instance from the 'breve abbatis' in the record of
Guy de Raimbercurt's aggressions:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg 36]</span></p>

<blockquote><p>
In melreda ii. hidas et dim. virg.</p>

<p>In meldeburne ii. hidas et dim.<a id="footnotetagid47" name="footnotetagid47"></a><a href="#footnoteid47"><sup>47</sup></a>
et dim. virg.</p>

<p>Hoc est iiii. hidas et iii. virg. Ex his sunt i. virg. et dim. <i>thainlande</i> et iiii.
hidas et dim.<a id="footnotetagid48" name="footnotetagid48"></a><a href="#footnoteid48"><sup>48</sup></a> <i>de soca</i>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>On reference to the two Manors in question, there is, at first sight,
nothing in the I.C.C., the I.E., or Domesday to distinguish the
'thegnland' from the 'sokeland'. Of the first holding we read that
it had been held T.R.E. by 10 <i>sochemanni</i> 'de soca S. Edelride'; of
the second, that it was held by 'viii. <i>sochemanni</i> ... homines abbatis de
Ely'. But closer examination of the I.C.C. reveals, in the former case,
this distinction:</p>

<blockquote><p>
De his ii. hidis et dimidia virga tenuit i. istorum <i>unam virgam et dimidiam</i>.
Non potuit dare nec vendere absque licentia abbatis. Sed alii novem potuerunt
recedere et vendere cui voluerunt.<a id="footnotetagid49" name="footnotetagid49"></a><a href="#footnoteid49"><sup>49</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Here then we identify the virgate and a half of 'theinland'&mdash;though
held by a <i>sochemannus</i>&mdash;and this same distinction of tenure proves
to be the key throughout. Thus, for instance, in the same document
'Herchenger pistor' is recorded to have seized 'in Hardwic i.
hidam <i>thainlande</i> et dim. hidam et vi. acras <i>de soca</i>' (p. 177).
Reference
to the I.C.C., D.B., and the I.E. reveals that the former holding
had belonged to 'v. sochemanni homines abbatis de ely', and that
'isti non potuerunt dare neque vendere alicui extra ecclesiam S.
Edeldride ely'.<a id="footnotetagid50" name="footnotetagid50"></a><a href="#footnoteid50"><sup>50</sup></a>
But the latter holding had belonged to a <i>sochemannus</i>,
of whom it is said&mdash;'homo abbatis de ely fuit: potuit recedere,
sed socam ejus abbas habuit'.<a id="footnotetagid51" name="footnotetagid51"></a><a href="#footnoteid51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>

<p>This enables us to understand the distinctions found in the
summaries appended to the Cambridgeshire portion of the I.E.,
and recorded in the <cite>Breve Abbatis</cite>. Indeed they confirm the above
distinction, for the formula they apply to holders 'de soca abbatie
ely' is: 'Illi qui hanc terram tenuerunt de soca T.R.E. vendere
potuerunt, sed saca et soca et commendatio et servitium semper
remanebat ecclesia de ely.'</p>

<p>These terms are valuable for their definition of rights. Over the
holder of land 'de soco' the lord had (1) 'saca et soca', (2) 'commendatio
et (3) servitium'. If the land was thegnland then the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg 37]</span>
Abbot received 'omnem consuetudinem' as well.<a id="footnotetagid52" name="footnotetagid52"></a><a href="#footnoteid52"><sup>52</sup></a>
We will first deal
with the latter class, those from whom the Abbot received 'consuetudo',
and then those who held 'de soca'.</p>

<p>For contemporary (indeed, slightly earlier) evidence, we must
turn to the Ely <cite>placitum</cite> of 1072-75.<a id="footnotetagid53" name="footnotetagid53"></a><a href="#footnoteid53"><sup>53</sup></a>
The special value which this
<cite>placitum</cite> possesses is found in its record of the services due from
<i>sochemanni</i>, and even from freemen. It thus helps to interpret the
bald figures of Domesday, to which it is actually anterior. The first
two instances it affords are these:</p>

<blockquote><p>
In breuessan tenet isdem W. terram Elfrici supradicte consuetudinis. In
brucge tenet ipse W. terram etfled ejusdem modi.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The <i>consuetudo</i> referred to was this:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Ita proprie sunt abbati ut quotienscunque preceperit prepositus monasterii
ire et omnem rei emendationem persolvere. Et si quid de suo voluerint
venundare, a preposito prius licentiam debent accipere.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The corresponding entries in the I.E. run thus:</p>

<blockquote><p>
'In Brugge una libera femina commend' S. &AElig;del. de lxxx. ac. pro
manerio.</p>

<p>In Beuresham ten[uit] &AElig;lfricus i. liber homo commed' S. &AElig;del.<a id="footnotetagid54" name="footnotetagid54"></a><a href="#footnoteid54"><sup>54</sup></a> lx.
acras pro manerio' (p. 165).
</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus we obtain direct evidence of the services due from commended
freemen owing 'consuetudines'. Turning now to those of
<i>sochemanni</i>, we have this important passage:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Willelmus de Warena tenet quadraginta quinque socamans in predicta
felteuuella qui quotiens abbas preceperit in anno arabunt suam terram,
colligent et purgabunt segetes, adducent et mittent in horrea, portabunt
victum monachorum ad monasterium, et quotiens eorum equos voluerit, et
ubicunque sibi placuerit, totiens habebit, et ubicunque forsfecerint abbas
forsfacturam habebit, et de illis similiter qui in eorum terram forsfecerint.</p>

<p>Item Willelmus de uuarenna tenet triginta tres socamans, istius consuetudinis
in Nortuuolda.</p>

<p>Item W. tenet quinque socamans istius modi in Muddaforda.</p>

<p>Supradictus Walterus et cum eo Durandus, homines hugonis de monte
forti, tenent xxvi. socamans supradicte consuetudinis in Maraham.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Collating as before from the I.E. the relative entries, we find they
run thus:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg 38]</span></p>

<blockquote><p>

 pro escangio, et mensurata
est in brevi S. &AElig;del. (p. 137).
</p></blockquote>

<p>Here then we identify these four cases: Feltwell, with its 41 <i>sochemanni</i>
(more accurately described as 34 s. and 7 <i>liberi homines</i>)
attached to one Manor and four to another&mdash;45 in all; Northwold,
with its 33 or 34;<a id="footnotetagid59" name="footnotetagid59"></a><a href="#footnoteid59"><sup>59</sup></a>
Muddiford with 5 or 7;<a id="footnotetagid60" name="footnotetagid60"></a><a href="#footnoteid60"><sup>60</sup></a>
and Marham with its 26.</p>

<p>The three former Manors lay in the Hundred of Grimeshoe, the
fourth northwards, towards the Wash. Just to the south of the three
Manors, over the borders of Suffolk, lay Brandon, where Lisois de
Moustiers had usurped the rights of Ely over six <i>sochemanni</i>.</p>

<blockquote><p>
In Lakincgeheda et in Brandona vi. sochemanni S. &AElig;del. ita quod non
potuerunt vendere terras liberati liseie antecessori eudo[nis] dapif[eri] ...
Post eum tenuit eos eudo et tenet cum saca et soca (p. 142).
</p></blockquote>

<p>The record of the <cite>placitum</cite>, drawn up during the tenure of Lisois,
shows us their limited services: 'Isti solummodo arabant et c'terent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg 39]</span>
[<i>sic</i>] messes ejusdem loci quotienscunque abbas pr&aelig;ceperit.' The
difference between these services and the others we have seen
recorded is considerable.</p>

<p>Yet another group of sokemen on Suffolk Manors rendered these
services:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Ita proprie sunt abbati ut quotienscunque ipse pr&aelig;ceperit in anno
arabunt suam terram, purgabunt et colligent segetes, portabunt victum
monachorum ad monasterium, equos eorum in suis necessitatibus habebit
[abbas], et ubicunque deliquerint emendationem habebit semper et de
omnibus illis qui in terris eorum deliquerint.
</p></blockquote>

<p>This is practically the same definition as we had for the other group,
and suggests that it was of wide prevalence. A notable contrast is
afforded by the entry: 'In villa que vocatur Blot tenet ipse R. iiii.
homines qui tantum debent servire abbati cum propriis equis in
omnibus necessitatibus suis.'</p>

<p>We have now examined the <i>consuetudines</i> due from those 'qui
vendere non potuerunt', and may turn to the rights exercised over
the other class. Excluding 'servitium' (which is usually omitted as
subordinate or comprised in the others), these are: (1) 'commendatio'
(2) 'saca et soca'. The distinction between the two meets us throughout
the survey of the eastern counties. A man might be 'commended'
to one lord while another held his <i>soca</i>. Thus we read of
Eadwine, a 'man' of the Abbot of Ely: 'Potuit dare absque eius
licentia, sed socam comes Algarus habuit.'<a id="footnotetagid61" name="footnotetagid61"></a><a href="#footnoteid61"><sup>61</sup></a>
That is to say, he was
'commended to the Abbot of Ely', but Earl &AElig;lfgar had the right of
'sac and soc' over him.<a id="footnotetagid62" name="footnotetagid62"></a><a href="#footnoteid62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>

<p>So too in the case of three 'liberi homines', commended to the
Abbot in Norfolk. He had no right over them, but such as commendation
conferred 'non habebat nisi commendationem', while
their 'soca' belonged to the King's Manor of Keninghall.<a id="footnotetagid63" name="footnotetagid63"></a><a href="#footnoteid63"><sup>63</sup></a>
Conversely,
the Abbot of Ely had the 'soca' of a 'man' of Earl Waltheof,<a id="footnotetagid64" name="footnotetagid64"></a><a href="#footnoteid64"><sup>64</sup></a>
and a 'man' of John, Waleran's nephew.<a id="footnotetagid65" name="footnotetagid65"></a><a href="#footnoteid65"><sup>65</sup></a>
'Commendatio', of
course, took precedence as a right. Thus we read of the above three
'liberi homines'&mdash;'Hos liberos homines tenet [tenuit] Ratfridus,
postea W. de Scodies, et abbas saisivit eos propter commendationem
suam' (p. 133).</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg 40]</span></p>

<p>In the above extracts we saw 'liberi homines qui vendere poterant'
distinguished from 'Sochemanni', who could not sell. But we also
saw that the two classes were not always carefully distinguished.
We find, moreover, that the 'liberi homines' were themselves,
sometimes, 'not free to sell'. Thus 'tenuit anant unus liber homo sub
S. &AElig;del. T.R.E. pro manerio ii. carucatas terr&aelig; sed non potuit vendere'
(p. 142). Some light may be thrown on this by the case of the
estate held by Godmund, an abbot's brother:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Totam terram quam tenebat Gudmundus in dominio, id est Nectuna,
sic tenebat T.R.E. de S. &AElig;del. quod nullo modo poterat vendere, nec dare;
sed post mortem suam debebat manerium redire in dominio ecclesi&aelig;; quia
tali pacto tenuit Gudmundus de Abbate (p. 144).
</p></blockquote>

<p>With this we may compare these entries:</p>

<blockquote><p>
In Cloptuna ... &AElig;dmundus commendatus S. &AElig;del. unam carucatam  ... quam
non potuit vendere nec dare (p. 150).</p>

<p>In Brandestuna &AElig;dmundus presbyter terram quam accepit cum femina
sua dedit S. &AElig;del. concedente femina T.R.E. ea conventione quod non
posset eam dare nec vendere. Similiter de Clopetona' (p. 152).
</p></blockquote>

<p>In these cases the holder had only a life interest. Exactly parallel
with the second is the case of 'Eadward', citizen of London, who gave
lands to St. Paul's, reserving a life interest for himself and his wife&mdash;'et
mortua illa Sanctus Paulus hereditare debuit'.<a id="footnotetagid66" name="footnotetagid66"></a><a href="#footnoteid66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>

<p>The above commendation of Edmund the priest ought to be
compared with that of 'unus liber homo S. &AElig;del. commendatus
<i>ita quod</i> non poterat vendere terram suam sine licentia abbatis',
and of 'i. liber homo S. &AElig;del. Commendatus <i>ita quod</i> non poterat
vendere terram suam extra ecclesiam (sed sacam et socam habuit
stigandus in hersham)'.<a id="footnotetagid67" name="footnotetagid67"></a><a href="#footnoteid67"><sup>67</sup></a>
Thus both those who were free to sell
and those who were not, might belong to the class of 'liberi homines'.
The essential distinction was one, not of status, but of tenure.</p>

<h4>IV. THE DOMESDAY CARUCA<a name="page40a" id="page40a"></a></h4>

<p>Yet more definite and striking, however, is the information on the
Domesday <i>caruca</i> afforded by collating D.B. with the I.C.C. I
referred at the Domesday Commemoration (1886) to the problem
raised by the <i>caruca</i>,<a id="footnotetagid68" name="footnotetagid68"></a><a href="#footnoteid68"><sup>68</sup></a>
and recorded my belief that in <cite>Domesday</cite> the
word must always mean a plough team of <em>eight</em> oxen. The eight oxen,
as Mr Seebohm has shown, are the key to the whole system of the
carucate and the bovate. In Domesday, as I argued, the <i>formula</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg 41]</span>
employed involves of necessity the conclusion that the <i>caruca</i> was
a fixed quantity. Such entries, moreover, as 'terra i. bovi', 'terra ad
iii. boves', etc., can only be explained on the hypothesis that the
relation of the <i>bos</i> to the <i>caruca</i> was constant. But as the
question is
one of undoubted perplexity, and as some, like Mr Pell, have
strenuously denied that the number of oxen in the Domesday
<i>caruca</i> was fixed,<a id="footnotetagid69" name="footnotetagid69"></a><a href="#footnoteid69"><sup>69</sup></a>
the evidence given below is as welcome as it is
conclusive:</p>

<p>It is absolutely certain from these entries that the scribes must have
deemed it quite immaterial whether they wrote 'dimidia caruca'
or 'iiii. boves'; as immaterial as it would be to us whether we wrote
'half a sovereign' or 'ten shillings'. It is, consequently, as absolutely
certain that the Domesday <i>caruca</i> was composed of eight oxen as that
our own sovereign is composed of twenty shillings. And from this
conclusion there is no escape.<a id="footnotetagid70" name="footnotetagid70"></a><a href="#footnoteid70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>

<p>Another point in connection with the <i>caruca</i> on which the I.C.C.
gives us the light we need is this:</p>

<p>Here the Domesday text is utterly misleading as it stands. But the
I.C.C., by supplying the omitted 'sex', gives us at once the right
sense.</p>

<h4>V. THE DOMESDAY HIDE<a name="page41a" id="page41a"></a></h4>

<p>Similar to its evidence on the Domesday 'plough' is that which the
I.C.C. affords as to the hide and virgate. In my criticism of Mr Pell's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg 42]</span>
learned paper, I strenuously opposed his view that the <i>hida</i> of
Domesday was composed of a variable number of virgates, and I
insisted on the fact that the Domesday 'virgate' was essentially and
always the <i>quarter</i> of the geldable 'hide'.<a id="footnotetagid71" name="footnotetagid71"></a><a href="#footnoteid71"><sup>71</sup></a>
The following parallel
passages will amply prove the fact:</p>

<p>These are only some of the passages of <i>direct</i> glossarial value.<a id="footnotetagid72" name="footnotetagid72"></a><a href="#footnoteid72"><sup>72</sup></a>
Indirectly, that is to say by analysis of the township assessments,
we obtain the same result throughout the survey <i>passim</i>.<a id="footnotetagid73" name="footnotetagid73"></a><a href="#footnoteid73"><sup>73</sup></a>
Here, again, we are able to assert that two virgates must have been to the
scribes as obviously equivalent to half a hide as ten shillings with us
are equivalent to half a sovereign. For here, again, the point is that
these scribes had no knowledge of the varying circumstances of each
locality. They had nothing to guide them but the return itself, so
that the rule, in Domesday, of 'four virgates to a hide' must have
been of universal application.</p>

<p>But not only were there thus, in Domesday, four virgates to a
hide; there were also in the Domesday virgate thirty Domesday
acres. Mr Eyton, though perhaps unrivalled in the study he has
bestowed on the subject, believed that there were only twelve such
acres, of which, therefore, forty-eight composed the Domesday
hide.<a id="footnotetagid74" name="footnotetagid74"></a><a href="#footnoteid74"><sup>74</sup></a>
It is, perhaps, the most important information to be derived
from the I.C.C. that <em>a hundred and twenty</em> Domesday acres composed
the Domesday hide.<a id="footnotetagid75" name="footnotetagid75"></a><a href="#footnoteid75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg 43]</span></p>

<p>We have the following direct statements:</p>

<p>If 20 acres were identical with two-thirds of a virgate, there must,
in a whole virgate, have been 30 acres; and if a virgate, <em>plus</em> 10
acres, was equivalent to half a hide minus 20 acres, we have again a
virgate of thirty, and a hide of 120 acres. But the conclusion I uphold
will be found to rest on no isolated facts. It is based on a careful
analysis of the <cite>Inquisitio</cite> throughout. Here are some striking examples:</p>

<p>This last example is, perhaps, the most remarkable of all, in the
accuracy with which the virgates and their fractions, by the help of
the five acres, combine to give us the required total.</p>

<p>But, it may be asked, how far does the <cite>Inquisitio</cite>, as a whole,
confirm this conclusion? In order to reply to this inquiry, I have
analysed every one of the Manors it contains. The result of that
analysis has been that of the ninety-four townships which the
fragment includes (not counting 'Matingeleia', of which the account
is imperfect) there are only fifteen cases in which my calculation
does not hold good, that is to say, in which the constituents as given
do not equal the total assessment when we add them up on the above
hypothesis of thirty acres to the virgate, and four virgates to the hide.
This number, however, would be considerably larger if we had to
work only from D.B., or only from the I.C.C. But as each of these,
in several cases, corrects the errors of the other, the total of apparent
exceptions is thus reduced. Hence I contend that if we could only
get a really perfect return, the remaining apparent exceptions would
largely disappear.</p>

<p>In some of these exceptions the discrepancy is trifling. Thus, at
Triplow, we have 2 acres in excess of the 8 hide assessment&mdash;a
discrepancy of <small><sup>1</sup></small>&frasl;<small>240</small>. At 'Burch and Weslai' we have a deficit of 5
acres on 10 hides, that is <small><sup>1</sup></small>&frasl;<small>240</small>. At 'Scelforda' the figures of D.B. give
us an excess of 7 acres on the 20 hide assessment, that is <small><sup>7</sup></small>&frasl;<small>2400</small>. The
I.C.C. figures make the excess to be 12 acres.</p>

<p>Another class of exceptions is accounted for by the tendency of
both texts, as we have seen, to enter a virgate too much or too little,
and to confuse virgates with their fractions. Thus at 'Litlingetona'
our figures give us a virgate in excess of the assessment, while at
'Bercheham'<a id="footnotetagid80" name="footnotetagid80"></a><a href="#footnoteid80"><sup>80</sup></a>
and again at 'Witlesforde' we have a virgate short of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg 46]</span>
the amount. At 'Herlestona' we have, similarly, half a virgate too
much, and 'Kingestona' half a virgate (15 acres) too little. Lastly,
at 'Wicheham', the aggregate of the figures is a quarter of a virgate
short of the amount.</p>

<p>A third class of these exceptions is due to the frequent omission
in the I.C.C. of estates belonging to the king. Thus at Wilbraham
it records an assessment of 10 hides represented only by two estates
of four hides apiece. But on turning to Domesday (i. 189 <i>b</i>) we read:
'Wilborham dominica villa regis est. Ibi ii. hid&aelig;.' The missing factor
is thus supplied, and the apparent discrepancy disposed of. So,
too, at 'Haslingefelda' (Haslingfield), where the I.C.C. accounts
only for twelve hides and three virgates out of an assessment of
twenty hides. Domesday here, again, supplies the missing factor in a
royal Manor of seven hides and a virgate. We thus obtain, instead of
an exception, a fresh illustration of our rule.</p>

<p>Domesday omits altogether, so far as I can find, the holding of
Guy, an omission which would upset the whole calculation. But, in
the case of Isleham, the apparent exception is due to the I.C.C.,
not to Domesday Book. Its assessment, in that document, is given as
four hides. But the aggregate of its Manors, as there recorded, gives
us an assessment of three hides <em>plus</em> eighty acres. Here any one who
was rash enough to argue from a single instance (as Mr Eyton and
Mr Pell were too apt to do) might jump at the conclusion that the
hide must here have been of eighty acres. Yet Domesday enables
us to collect all the constituents of the 'Vill', among them the
king's estate, here again omitted. The real figures, therefore, were
these:</p>

<p>Isleham, then, was a normal ten-hide township, and confirms, instead
of rebutting, the rule that the geldable hide contained 120 acres.<a id="footnotetagid81" name="footnotetagid81"></a><a href="#footnoteid81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>

<p>The remaining exceptions are 'Somm[er]tona' partly explained
by the omission of <i>terra Regis</i>, 'Bathburgeham' (Babraham) with
21 acres short of an assessment of 7 hides, and Carlton, which fitly
closes the list of these exceptions. For here, on an assessment of
10 hides, we have, according to the I.C.C., 27 acres short, but,
according to D.B., 53&frac12; (27 + 20 + 6&frac12;). A demonstrable blunder in
Domesday Book and a discrepancy between it and the I.C.C. are
responsible, together, for the difference.<a id="footnotetagid82" name="footnotetagid82"></a><a href="#footnoteid82"><sup>82</sup></a>
Thus we see how wide a
margin should be allowed, in these calculations, for textual error.</p>

<p>It is necessary to remember that there were three processes, in
each one of which error might arise:</p>

<p>I. In the actual survey and its returns, 'by reason of the insignificance
of some estates, or by reason of forgetfulness, or inaccuracy,
or confusion, or doubt on the part of local jurors and
witnesses, or of the clerks who indited their statements'.<a id="footnotetagid83" name="footnotetagid83"></a><a href="#footnoteid83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>

<p>II. In the collection and transmission of the returns, by the loss
of a 'leaflet or rotulet of the commissioners' work'.<a id="footnotetagid84" name="footnotetagid84"></a><a href="#footnoteid84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>

<p>III. In the transcription of the returns into D.B., or into the
I.C.C., <em>plus</em>, in the case of the former, the rearrangement and
abridgment of the materials.</p>

<p>We may now quit this part of our subject, claiming to have
settled, by the aid of the I.C.C., a problem which has puzzled
generations of antiquaries, namely: 'What was the Domesday
hide?'<a id="footnotetagid85" name="footnotetagid85"></a><a href="#footnoteid85"><sup>85</sup></a>
We have shown that it denoted a measure of assessment
composed of four (geld) virgates or a hundred and twenty (geld)
acres. What relation, if any, it bore to <em>area</em> and to <em>value</em> is a
question wholly distinct, on which the next portion of this essay may throw
quite a new light.</p>

<h4>VI. THE FIVE-HIDE UNIT<a name="page47a" id="page47a"></a></h4>

<p>It is one of the distinctive and valuable features of the <cite>Inq. Com.
Cant.</cite> that it gives us the total assessment for each Vill of which it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg 48]</span>
treats before recording the several Manors of which that Vill is
composed, the aggregate assessments of which Manors make up the
total assessment for the Vill. In this feature we have something
which Domesday does not contain, and which (independently of its
checking value),<a id="footnotetagid86" name="footnotetagid86"></a><a href="#footnoteid86"><sup>86</sup></a>
gives us at once those Vill assessments which we
could only extract from the Domesday entries by great labour and
with much uncertainty. Let us see then if these Vill assessments lead
us to any new conclusions on the whole assessment system.</p>

<p>The first point that we notice is this. The <em>five-hide unit</em> is brought
into startling prominence. No careful student, one would suppose,
of Domesday, can have failed to be struck by the singular number of
Manors in the hidated portion of the realm, which are assessed in
terms of the five-hide unit, that is to say, which are entered as of
five hides or some multiple of five hides. This is specially the case
with towns, and some years ago, in one of my earliest essays, I called
attention to the fact, and explained its bearing in connection with
the unit of military service.<a id="footnotetagid87" name="footnotetagid87"></a><a href="#footnoteid87"><sup>87</sup></a>
Yet no one, it would seem, has been
struck by the fact, or has seen that there must be some significance
in this singular preponderance of five-hide Manors. Now what the
<cite>Inquisitio</cite> here does for us is to show us that this preponderance is
infinitely greater than we should gather from the pages of Domesday,
and that when the scattered Manors are pieced together in their
Vills, the aggregate of their assessments generally amounts either to
five hides or to a multiple of the five-hide unit. Thus the rural
townships are brought into line with towns, and we learn that in
both the assessment was based on the <em>five-hide unit</em>.</p>

<p>Let us now take a typical Hundred and test this theory in practice:</p>

<p>Here we have five Vills varying in area from eleven ploughlands to
twenty, and in value T.R.E., from &pound;11 10s to &pound;20, all assessed
alike at ten hides each. What is the meaning of it? Simply that
ASSESSMENT BORE NO RATIO TO AREA OR TO VALUE in a Vill, and still
less in a Manor.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg 49]</span></p>

<p>Assessment was not objective, but subjective; it was not fixed
relatively to area or to value, but to the five-hide unit. The aim of
the assessors was clearly to arrange the assessment in sums of five
hides, ten hides, etc.</p>

<p>Here again we have seven Vills varying in area from thirteen and
a quarter ploughlands to twenty, and in value from &pound;8 8s to &pound;19 5s,
all uniformly assessed at ten hides each. The thing speaks for itself.
Had the hidation in these two Hundreds been dependent on area
or value, the assessments would have varied infinitely. As it is,
there is for each Vill but one and the same assessment.</p>

<p>Note further that the I.C.C. enables us to localize holdings the
locality of which is unnamed in Domesday: also, that it shows us
how certain Vills were combined for the purpose of assessment.
Thus Borough Green and Westley are treated in Domesday as
distinct, but here we find that they were assessed together as a
ten-hide block. By this means we are enabled to see how the five-hide
system could be traced further still if we had in other districts
the same means of learning how two or three Vills were thus grouped
together.</p>

<p>We may now take a step in advance, and pass to the Hundred of
Whittlesford.</p>

Here we are left to discover for ourselves that Whittlesford and
Sawston were grouped together to form a twenty-hide block. And
on turning from the above figures to the map we find the discovery
verified, these two Vills jointly occupying the northern portion of the
hundred. Thus, this hundred, instead of being divided like its two
predecessors into ten-hide blocks, was assessed in four blocks of
twenty hides each, each of them representing one of those quarters
so dear to the Anglo-Saxon mind (<i>virgata</i>, etc.), and lying respectively
in the north, south, east and west of the district. Proceeding on the
lines of this discovery, we come to the Hundred of Wetherley, which
carries us a step further.</p>

<p>It is important to observe that, though the grouping is my own,
the <em>order</em> of the Vills is exactly that which is given in the <cite>Inq. Com.
Cant.</cite>, and by that order the grouping is confirmed. Note also how,
without such grouping, we should have but a chaos of Vills, whereas,
by its aid, from this chaos is evolved perfect symmetry. Lastly,
glance at the four 'quarters' and see how variously they are subdivided.</p>

<p>Advancing still on the same lines, we approach the very remarkable
case of the adjoining Hundred of Long Stow.</p>

<p>Now it is necessary to explain at the outset that, the <cite>Inq. Com. Cant.</cite>
being here imperfect, it only gives us the first two of the above
'quarters', its evidence ending with Bourne. But, by good fortune, it
is possible to reconstruct from Domesday alone the remaining half
of the Hundred, and thus to obtain the most valuable example of the
system we are engaged in tracing that we have yet met with. The
grouping I have adopted is based on the figures, but in some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg 51]</span>
cases it is obvious from the map: Eltisley and Croxton, for instance,
which form a ten-hide block, occupy a projecting portion of the
county all to themselves, while Caxton adjoins them.</p>

<p>Several points are here noticeable. Observe, in the first place,
how the twenty-five hide 'quarter' which heads the list is divided
into three <em>equal</em> blocks of 8&#8531; hides each, just as we found in
Wetherley
Hundred that one of the twenty-hide 'quarters' was divided into
five <em>equal</em> blocks of four hides each. In these cases the same principle
of simple equal division was applied to the quarter hundred as we
saw applied to the whole hundred in the first two cases we studied&mdash;the
Hundreds of Staines and of Radfield. Notice next how the two
Vills of Toft and Hardwick, which are separately surveyed in
Domesday under their respective names, are found from the <cite>Inq.
Com. Cant.</cite> to have combined (under the name of 'Toft') in a block
of 8&#8531; hides. Lastly, it should not be overlooked that the &frac34; hide not
localized in Domesday fits in exactly with Hatley to complete its
five hides.</p>

<p>The chase now becomes exciting: it can no longer be doubted
that we are well on the track of a vast system of artificial hidation,
of which the very existence has been hitherto unsuspected. Let us
see what further light can be thrown by research on its nature.</p>

<p>On looking back at the evidence I have collected, one is struck,
surely, by the thought that the system of assessment seems to work,
not as is supposed, <em>up from</em>, but <em>down to</em> the Manor. Can it be
possible that what was really assessed was not the Manor, nor even the Vill,
but the Hundred as a whole? This view is so revolutionary, so subversive
of all that has ever been written on the subject, that it
cannot be answered off-hand. We will therefore begin by examining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg 52]</span>
the case of the Hundred of Erningford, which introduces us to a
further phenomenon, the <em>reduction</em> of assessment.</p>

<p>Here we have, as in the last instance, a Hundred of exactly a
hundred hides (assessment). But we are confronted with a new
problem, that of reduction. Before we form any conclusions, it is
important to explain that this problem can only be studied by the
aid of the <cite>Inq. Com. Cant.</cite>, for the evidence both of Domesday and of
the <cite>Inq. El.</cite> is distinctly misleading. Reduction of assessment is only
recorded in these two documents when the Manor is identical with
the Vill. In cases where the Vill contains two or more Manors, the
Vill is not entered as a whole, and consequently the reduction on the
assessment of that Vill as a whole is not entered at all.</p>

<p>After this explanation I pass to the case of the above Hundred,
in which the evidence on the reduction is fortunately perfect. The
first point to be noticed is that in four out of the five Hundreds that
we have as yet examined, there is not a single instance of reduction,
whereas here, on the contrary, the assessment is reduced in every Vill
throughout the Hundred. That is to say, the reduction is <em>conterminous
with the Hundred</em>. Cross its border into the Hundred of
Wetherley, or of Triplow, and in neither district will you find a
trace of reduction. Observe next that the reduction is <em>uniform</em> throughout
the whole, being 20 per cent in every instance. Now what is the
inevitable conclusion from the <i>data</i> thus afforded? Obviously
that the reduction was made on the assessment of the Hundred <em>as a
whole</em>, and that this reduction was distributed among its several Vills
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg 53]</span>
<i>pro rata</i>.<a id="footnotetagid89" name="footnotetagid89"></a><a href="#footnoteid89"><sup>89</sup></a>
Further research confirms the conclusion that these
reductions were systematically made on <em>Hundreds</em>, not on Vills.
There is a well defined belt, or rather crescent, of Hundreds, in all of
which the assessment is reduced. They follow one another on the
map in this order: Erningford, Long Stow, Papworth, North Stow,
Staplehow, and Cheveley. Within this crescent there lies a compact
block of Hundreds, in no one of which has a single assessment been
reduced. They are Triplow, Wetherley (? Cambridge<a id="footnotetagid90" name="footnotetagid90"></a><a href="#footnoteid90"><sup>90</sup></a>),
Flendish, Staines, Radfield, Chilford and Whittlesford. Beyond the crescent
there lie 'the two Hundreds of Ely', in which, so far as our evidence
goes, there would seem to have been similarly no reduction. As the
two horns of the crescent, so to speak, are the Hundreds of Erningford
and Cheveley, we will now glance at the latter, and compare
the evidence of the two.</p>

<p>As a preliminary point, attention may be called to the fact that the
grouping of Ashley and Silverley, although they are surveyed
separately in the <cite>Inq. Com. Cant.</cite>, is justified by their forming, as
'Ashley-cum-Silverley' a single parish. So too, Saxon Street may be
safely combined with Ditton, in which it is actually situate. We thus
have a Hundred of fifty hides divided into five blocks of ten hides
each, and thus presenting a precise parallel to the Hundred of
Staines, the first that we examined.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg 54]</span></p>

<p>And now for the reductions. As the Vill of Cheveley, unluckily,
is nowhere surveyed as a whole, we have in its case no evidence.
But of the five remaining Vills above (counting Ashley-cum-Silverley
as one), four we see had had their assessments reduced on a
<em>uniform</em> scale, just as in the Hundred of Long Stow. Now this is a
singular circumstance, and it leads me to this conclusion. I believe
that, precisely as in the latter case, the assessment of the Hundred
<em>as a whole</em> was reduced by twenty hides. This was equivalent to
40 per cent, which was accordingly knocked off from the assessment
of each of its constituent Vills. One of the Dittons is clearly an
exception, having nine hides, not four, thus knocked off. I would
suggest, as the reason for this exception, that Ditton having now
become a 'dominica villa regis' (<cite>Inq. Com. Cant.</cite>, p. 10), was specially
favoured by having a five-hide unit further knocked off its assessment,
just as in the case of Chippenham (<cite>Ibid.</cite>, p. 2).<a id="footnotetagid94" name="footnotetagid94"></a><a href="#footnoteid94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>

<p>It has been my object in the above argument to recall attention
to the corporate character, the <i>solidarit&eacute;</i> of the Hundred. This
character, of which the traces are preserved in its collective responsibility,
even now, for damages caused by riot, strongly favours the
view which I am here bringing forward, that it was the Hundred
itself which was assessed for geld, and which was held responsible for
its payment. Although this view is absolutely novel, and indeed
destructive of the accepted belief, it is in complete harmony with the
general principle enunciated by Dr Stubbs, and is a further proof
of the confirmation which his views often obtain from research and
discovery. Treating of 'the Hundred as an area for rating', he writes
thus:</p>

<blockquote><p>
There can be no doubt that the organization of the Hundred had a fiscal
importance, not merely as furnishing the profits of fines and the produce
of demesne or folkland, but as forming a rateable division of the county.<a id="footnotetagid95" name="footnotetagid95"></a><a href="#footnoteid95"><sup>95</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Now there are several circumstances which undoubtedly point
to my own conclusion. We know from the <cite>Inq. Com. Cant.</cite>, that the
Domesday Commissioners held their inquiry in the Court of each
Hundred, and had for jurors the men of that Hundred. Now if the
Hundred, as I suggest, was assessed for geld as a whole, its representatives
would be clearly the parties most interested in seeing that
each Vill or Manor was debited with its correct share of the general
liability. Again we know from the <cite>Inquisitio Geldi</cite> that the geld was
collected and paid through the machinery of the Hundred; and its
collectors, in Devonshire, are 'Hundremanni'. The Hundred, in fact,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg 55]</span>
was the unit for the purpose.<a id="footnotetagid96" name="footnotetagid96"></a><a href="#footnoteid96"><sup>96</sup></a>
Further, we have testimony to the
same effect in the survey of East Anglia. But as that survey stands by
itself, it must have separate treatment.<a id="footnotetagid97" name="footnotetagid97"></a><a href="#footnoteid97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>

<p>I need not further discuss the collective liability of the Hundred,
having already shown in my 'Danegeld' paper how many allusions
to it are to be found in Domesday in the case of urban 'Hundreds'.<a id="footnotetagid98" name="footnotetagid98"></a><a href="#footnoteid98"><sup>98</sup></a>
It is only necessary here to add, as a corollary of this conclusion,
that the assessment of a single Manor could not be reduced by the
Crown without the amount of that reduction falling upon the rest
of the Hundred. Either therefore, that amount must have been
allowed ('computatum') to the local collector as were <i>terr&aelig; dat&aelig;</i>
to the sheriff, or (which came to the same thing) the assessment on
the Hundred must have been reduced <i>pro tanto</i>.</p>

<p>I now proceed to apply my theory that the Hundreds themselves
were first assessed, and that such assessments were multiples of the
five-hide unit.</p>

<p>We are enabled from the <cite>Inq. Com. Cant.</cite>, to determine the
assessments of eleven Hundreds.<a id="footnotetagid99" name="footnotetagid99"></a><a href="#footnoteid99"><sup>99</sup></a>
Nine out of these eleven Hundreds
prove to have been assessed as follows:</p>

<p>This list speaks for itself, but it may be as well to point out how
convenient for the Treasury was this system. At the normal Danegeld
rate of two shillings on the hide, an assessment of fifty hides would
represent &pound;5, one hundred hides &pound;10, and so on.</p>

<p>Can we discover in other counties traces of this same system?
Let us first take the adjacent county of Bedfordshire.</p>

<p>I am anxious to explain that for the means of utilizing the Bedfordshire
evidence I am entirely indebted to the <cite>Digest of the Domesday
of Bedfordshire</cite> by the late Rev. William Airy (edited by his son, the
Rev. B. R. Airy<a id="footnotetagid101" name="footnotetagid101"></a><a href="#footnoteid101"><sup>101</sup></a>).
It was, most happily, pointed out to the author
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg 56]</span>
by the Rev. Joseph Hunter 'that what we want is not translations but
analyses of the surveys of the several counties' (p. viii). To this
most true remark we owe it that Mr Airy resolved to give us a 'digest'
instead of that usual 'extension and translation', which is perfectly
useless to the Domesday student. It is easy to take from the record
itself such an instance as these Beauchamp Manors entered in
succession (213): Willington 10 hides, Stotford 15; 'Houstone' 5,
Hawnes 5, 'Salchou' 5, Aspley 10, Salford 5; but it is only Mr Airy's
work that enables us to reconstruct the townships, and to show how
fractions&mdash;apparently meaningless&mdash;fit in, exactly as in Cambridgeshire,
with one another. His work is all the more valuable from the
fact that he had no theory to prove, and did not even add together
the factors he had ascertained. His figures therefore are absolutely
free from the suspicion that always attaches to those adduced to
prove a case.</p>

<p>In the first case there is a deficiency of <small><sup>1</sup></small>&frasl;<small>120</small>, and in the second of
<small><sup>7</sup></small>&frasl;<small>80</small>, while in the third we find an excess of <small><sup>1</sup></small>&frasl;<small>160</small>. No one can doubt that
these were really ten-hide, ten-hide, and forty-hide townships. We
have to allow, in the first place, for trivial slips, and in the second
for possible errors in the baffling work of identification at the
present day. One can hardly doubt that if a student with the
requisite local knowledge set himself to reconstruct, according to
Hundreds, the Bedfordshire Domesday, he would find, as in
Cambridgeshire, that even where a township was not assessed in
terms of the five-hide unit, it was combined in an adjacent one in
such an assessment.</p>

<p>We will now cross the border into Huntingdonshire, and enter the
great Hundred of Hurstingston. This, which may be described as a
<em>double</em> Hundred, was assessed, Domesday implies, at 200 hides.
Quartering this total, on the Cambridgeshire system, we obtain
fifty hides, and this quarter was the assessment allotted to the
borough of Huntingdon.<a id="footnotetagid102" name="footnotetagid102"></a><a href="#footnoteid102"><sup>102</sup></a> The total assessment of the Hundred was
thus accounted for:</p>

<p>Passing on into Northamptonshire, we come to that most curious
document, which I shall discuss below (<i>see</i> p. <a href="#page124">124</a>), and which was
printed by Ellis (<cite>Introduction to Domesday</cite>, i. 187 <i>et seq.</i>).
Ellis, however,
can scarcely have read his own document, for he speaks of it as a
list 'in which every Hundred is made to consist of a <em>hundred hides</em>'.<a id="footnotetagid106" name="footnotetagid106"></a><a href="#footnoteid106"><sup>106</sup></a>
This extraordinary assertion has completely misled Dr Stubbs, who
writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>
The document given by Ellis as showing that the Hundreds of Northampton
each contained a hundred hides seems to be a mere attempt of an early
scribe to force them into symmetry.<a id="footnotetagid107" name="footnotetagid107"></a><a href="#footnoteid107"><sup>107</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>It is greatly to be wished that some one with the requisite local
knowledge should take this list in hand and work out its details
thoroughly. In capable hands it should prove a record of the highest
interest. For the present I will only point out that its contents are
in complete harmony with the results that I obtained on the
Hundred in Cambridgeshire; for it gives us Hundreds assessed at
150 (four), 100 (nine), 90 (two), 80 (four), 60 (one), and 40 (one)
hides, with a small minority of odd numbers. This list throws further
light on the institution of the Hundred by its recognition of 'double'
and 'half' Hundreds. Note also in this connection the preference for
100-hide and fifty-hide assessments, which here amount to thirteen
out of the twenty instances above, and in Cambridgeshire to four
out of nine. These signs of an endeavour to force such assessments
into terms of a fifty-hide unit will be dealt with below.<a id="footnotetagid108" name="footnotetagid108"></a><a href="#footnoteid108"><sup>108</sup></a></p>

<p>In Hertfordshire, as indeed in other counties, there is great need
for that local research which alone can identify and group the
Domesday holdings. So far as single Vills are concerned, Bengeo
affords a good illustration of the way in which scattered fractions
work out in combination.</p>

<p>If we now push on to Worcestershire, we find a striking case in the
Hundred (or rather the triple Hundred<a id="footnotetagid109" name="footnotetagid109"></a><a href="#footnoteid109"><sup>109</sup></a>)
of Oswaldslow. Its assessment
was 300 hides;<a id="footnotetagid110" name="footnotetagid110"></a><a href="#footnoteid110"><sup>110</sup></a>
and I am able to assert that of these we can
account for 299, and that it contained Manors of 50, 40, 35, 25 (two),
and 15 hides.<a id="footnotetagid111" name="footnotetagid111"></a><a href="#footnoteid111"><sup>111</sup></a>
We have also, in this county, the case of the Hundred
of Fishborough, made up to 100 hides, and remarkable for including
in this total the fifteen hides at which Worcester itself was assessed.
The special value of this and of the Huntingdon instances lies in its
placing the assessments of a borough on all fours with the assessment
of a rural Manor, as a mere factor in the assessment of a rural
Hundred. By thus combining town and country it shows us that the
assessments of both were part of the same general system. This is a
point of great importance.</p>

<p>This case of the Hundred of Fishborough is, however, peculiar.
The entry, which was prominently quoted by Ellis (who failed to
see its true significance), is this:</p>

<blockquote><p>
In Fisseberge hundred habet &aelig;cclesia de Euesham lxv. hid&aelig;. Ex his xii.
hid&aelig; sunt liber&aelig;. In illo Hundredo jacent xx. hid&aelig; de dodentreu. et xv.
hid&aelig; de Wircecestre perficiunt hundred.<a id="footnotetagid112" name="footnotetagid112"></a><a href="#footnoteid112"><sup>112</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Now this entry is purely incidental, and its real meaning is this.
In the true Hundred of Fishborough (adjoining Evesham on the
east), Evesham Abbey held sixty-five hides (assessed value), of which
twelve were exempted from payment of geld, a statement which can
be absolutely verified from the details given. To this aggregate was
added the fifteen hides of Worcester (though in another part of the
county), together with twenty hides of the distant <i>Hundred</i> of Doddentree.
A total of 100 hides was that arrived at. Now the Hundred of
Doddentree had itself made up to about 120 hides,<a id="footnotetagid113" name="footnotetagid113"></a><a href="#footnoteid113"><sup>113</sup></a>
by the addition of eighteen hides, which belonged to Hertford as to
'firma'.<a id="footnotetagid114" name="footnotetagid114"></a><a href="#footnoteid114"><sup>114</sup></a>
A reduction, therefore, of twenty hides suggests a complicated
process of levelling the local Hundreds, which may remind
us how large a margin must be allowed for these arrangements.</p>

<p>Before leaving Worcestershire, attention should be called to the
great Manor of Pershore, which Westminster Abbey held for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg 61]</span>
200 hides, and to the 100 hides connected therewith under the
heading 'Terra sanct&aelig; Mari&aelig; de Persore'.</p>

<p>In Somerset we find some good instances, with the help of Mr
Eyton's analyses.</p>

<p>There are also abundant cases of <i>Manors</i> which work out similarly
such as Walton and its group (4&frac12; + 5 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2&frac12; = 20), Butleigh
(7&frac12; + 8 + 2 + &frac12; + 2 = 20). Again, in the Hundred of Frome we find
eight Manors (Camerton, Englishcombe, Charterhouse Hinton,
Norton St Philip, Corston, Beckington, Cloford, and Laverton),
assessed at ten hides each, in addition to divided Manors, such as
Road (9 + 1), and Tiverton (7&frac12; + 2&frac12;).<a id="footnotetagid115" name="footnotetagid115"></a><a href="#footnoteid115"><sup>115</sup></a></p>

<p>We will now pass to Devon and examine the assessments of its
Hundreds. Of these thirty-one are entered in the <cite>Inquisitio Geldi</cite>.
Now, as four virgates went to the hide, such assessments as 25&frac34;, 9&frac14;
hides, show us that the simple doctrine of probability is in favour of
only one Hundred in every twenty proving to be assessed in multiples
of the five-hide unit. Yet we find that those so assessed form an
absolute majority of the whole. When classified, they run thus&mdash;50
(four), 40 (one), 30 (two), 25 (four), 20 (five): total, 16 Hundreds.</p>

<p>It will at once be observed that these assessments are, as nearly as
possible, on one half the scale of those we met with in Cambridgeshire
and Northamptonshire. But this must be taken in conjunction
with the fact that the Devon and Cornwall assessments are altogether
peculiar. 'In Devon and Cornwall, where the scope of the gheld-hide
was enormous, it was necessary to introduce another quantity,
intermediate between the virgate and the acre. This was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg 62]</span>
Ferndel or Ferdingdel, to wit, the fourth part of the next superior
denomination, the fourth part of the virgate.'<a id="footnotetagid116" name="footnotetagid116"></a><a href="#footnoteid116"><sup>116</sup></a>
One might at first sight be tempted to suggest that the hide was in these two counties a
term of higher denomination when we find Manor after Manor
assessed at a fraction of a hide, while in Cornwall the 'acra terr&aelig;' was
clearly a peculiar measure.<a id="footnotetagid117" name="footnotetagid117"></a><a href="#footnoteid117"><sup>117</sup></a>
Yet in some Manors adjacent to Exeter or to the neighbouring coast the assessment is much less
abnormally low, though even there moderate. There is much scope,
here also, for intelligent local research, although we may conclude,
from the evidence of the Pipe Rolls, that the hide represented the
same unit here as elsewhere, as it would seem did the Devonshire
Hundred, in spite of its singularly low average assessment. Indeed, it
represented a larger, not a smaller, area than usual. I shall deal
with this phenomenon below, and endeavour to explain its significance.
For the present it is only necessary to insist on the evidence
that the Hundreds afford of assessment on the five-hide system.</p>

<p>Indeed, though I definitely advance the suggestion that the
assessment was, in the first instance, laid upon the Hundred itself,
and that the subsequent assessment of its Vills and Manors was
arrived at by division and subdivision, the truth or falsehood of
this theory in no way affects the indisputable phenomenon of the
five-hide unit. On the prominence of that unit I take my stand as
absolute proof that the hide assessment was fixed <em>independently of
area or value</em>, and that, consequently, all the attempts that have been
made by ingenious men to discover and establish the relation which
that assessment bore to area, whether in Vill or Manor, have proved
not only contradictory among themselves, but, as was inevitable,
vain.</p>

<p>The late Mr Eyton did much to destroy the old belief held
by Kemble and other well-known writers that the Domesday
hide was an areal measure and to substitute the sounder view that
it was used as a term of assessment, and Mr Chester Waters, in his
<cite>Survey of Lindsey</cite> (1883), claimed that the 'key to the puzzle' had been
thus finally discovered. Canon Taylor, on the other hand, at the
Domesday Commemoration (1886), claimed that if his own most
ingenious theory of the relation of the geld-carucate to area could be
more generally extended, 'many volumes of Domesday exposition,
including, among others, Mr Eyton's <cite>Key to Domesday</cite>, may be finally
consigned <i>al limbo dei bambini</i>'.<a id="footnotetagid118" name="footnotetagid118"></a><a href="#footnoteid118"><sup>118</sup></a>
Mr Pell's theories&mdash;the inclusion
of which at enormous length in <cite>Domesday Studies</cite><a id="footnotetagid119" name="footnotetagid119"></a><a href="#footnoteid119"><sup>119</sup></a>
cannot be too<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg 63]</span>
deeply regretted&mdash;require a passing notice. According to him, the
Domesday hide was virtually an areal term; but the interests of
truth and of historical research require, as to his confident calculations,
very plain speaking. Although I devoted to the investigation
of Mr Pell's theories a deplorable amount of time and labour,<a id="footnotetagid120" name="footnotetagid120"></a><a href="#footnoteid120"><sup>120</sup></a>
I would rather state the inevitable conclusion in the words of that
sound scholar, Mr W. H. Stevenson:</p>

<blockquote><p>
All the fanciful calculations that Mr Pell has based upon this assumption,
including his delicious 'Ready Reckoner', may be safely left to slumber in
oblivion by the Domesday student who does not wish to waste his time.</p>

<p>The only abiding principle underlying Mr Pell's calculations is that the
figures in Domesday, or wherever found, have to produce a certain total
that Mr Pell has already fixed upon. To do this, virgates may mean hides,
carucates may mean virgates, and, in short, anything may mean anything
else.<a id="footnotetagid121" name="footnotetagid121"></a><a href="#footnoteid121"><sup>121</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Although Mr Eyton also indulged in 'fanciful calculations', and
committed the fatal error of combining facts and fancies, he was at
least on the right track in discarding the notion that the Domesday
hide denoted a fixed area, and in treating it as a term of assessment.
At the same time, the acceptance of my theory that this assessment
was not determined by the real value of the Manor or Vill,
but was unconnected with it, would be, of course, destructive of all
his calculations.</p>

<p>The five-hide unit which lies at the root of my theory is found
ever to the front, turn where we will. In Oxon<a id="footnotetagid122" name="footnotetagid122"></a><a href="#footnoteid122"><sup>122</sup></a> we find entered in
succession the Bishop of Lincoln's Manors 90, 60, 40, 50, 50 hides,
while if we work through the southern extremity of the county
(lying south of Ewelme), following the bend of the Thames, we find
the assessments are as follows: Preston Crowmarsh, 5; Crowmarsh
Gifford, 10; Newnham Murren, 10; Mongewell, 10; Ipsden, 5;
North and South Stoke, 20&frac14;; Checkenden, 5; Goring, 20; Gethampton,
6&frac12;; Whitchurch, 10; Mapledurham, 10; Caversham, 20;
Dunsden, 20; Bolney (8) and Lashbrook (12) 20; Harpsden, 5;
Rotherfield, 10; Badgemoor, 5; Bix 5. So too on the western border
we have in succession Churchill, 20; Kingham, 10; Foxcote (1)
and Tilbury (14), 15; Lyneham, 10; Fyfield, 5; Tainton, 10;
Upton, 5; Burford (8) and Widford (2), 10; Westwell, 5.<a id="footnotetagid123" name="footnotetagid123"></a><a href="#footnoteid123"><sup>123</sup></a></p>

<p>Berkshire undoubtedly offers a fruitful sphere of study. On the
one hand, we have so large a proportion of Manors assessed at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg 64]</span>
5, 10, 15, 20 hides, and so forth as to strike the reader at once
without special research; on the other, we find these archaic assessments
reduced under the Conqueror in the most sweeping manner,
and the old system thus effaced. Fortunately for us in this case
its existence is recorded in the Domesday entries of the previous
assessments. What is here, as elsewhere, wanted is a thorough
local analysis of the hidage, Hundred by Hundred. For no county
is such an analysis more urgently needed.</p>

<p>In Bucks the Primate's three Manors are of 40, 5, 30 hides,
while nine Manors of Walter Giffard follow one another with
these assessments: 20, 10, 10, 20, 3&frac12;, 10, 5, 5, 10; and in Gloucestershire
we are met on every side by Manors of 5, 10, 15, 20 hides, and
so on. In Surrey, the Primate's six Manors are assessed at 30, 20
80, 5, 20, 14 hides. As a proof that this feature is in no way of my
own creation, I will take the Wiltshire Manors selected by Mr Pell for
his tables. Seven out of the eleven selected by him are five-hide
assessments, being 5, 10, 20, 40, 20, 5, 10. The marvel is that any
one can have failed to observe the general occurrence of the fact.</p>

<p>In Middlesex the five-hide unit is peculiarly prominent. We have
only to glance at the pages of Domesday to be struck by such assessments
as Harrow (100 hides), Fulham (50 hides<a id="footnotetagid124" name="footnotetagid124"></a><a href="#footnoteid124"><sup>124</sup></a>),
Isleworth (70 hides), Harmondsworth (30 hides), while on folios 129<span class="sc">b</span>-130, we
have seven Manors in succession of which the assessments are 15,
35, 30, 30, 7&frac12;, 15, 10, representing 3, 7, 6, 6, 1&frac12;, 3, 2, multiples of
the
five-hide unit. But, here again, conspicuous as is this unit even in the
case of Manors, its prevalence would be still more apparent, if we
could reconstruct the Vills. Thus, for instance, in the Hundred of
Spelthorne we find these assessments:</p>

<p>'Exeforde' is Ashford, which 'appears from a very early period till
after the dissolution of the monasteries to have been an appendage of
Stains'.<a id="footnotetagid127" name="footnotetagid127"></a><a href="#footnoteid127"><sup>127</sup></a>
Thus we obtain an assessment of 20 hides for Staines <i>cum</i>
Ashford. So too we have at once for Laleham an assessment of ten
hides, while that of East and West Bedfont was, we see, twenty hides.
The most striking case, however, is that of Hatton; for, if we add to
its two named Manors the nameless estates in the above list, the four fit
in like a puzzle, giving us an aggregate assessment of exactly five hides.</p>

<p>The hundred, therefore, was assessed thus:</p>

<p>Let us now connect the territorial with the institutional unit.
Dealing in my 'Danegeld' essay with the evident assessment of
towns in terms of the five-hide unit, I traced it to the fact that 'five
hides were the unit of assessment for the purpose of military
service'.<a id="footnotetagid128" name="footnotetagid128"></a><a href="#footnoteid128"><sup>128</sup></a>
The evidence I have adduced in the present paper
carries further its significance; but we must not allow its financial to
obscure its military importance. I appealed, at that time, to the
Exeter instance:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Quando expeditio ibat per terram aut per mare serviebat h&aelig;c civitas
quantum v. hid&aelig; terr&aelig;;
</p></blockquote>

<p>and to the service of Malmesbury:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Quando rex ibat in expeditione vel terra vel mari habebat de hoc burgo
aut xx. solidos ad pascendos suos buzecarlos aut unum hominem ducebat
secum pro honore v. hidarum.<a id="footnotetagid129" name="footnotetagid129"></a><a href="#footnoteid129"><sup>129</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course this brings us to the notoriously difficult question of the
thegn and his qualification. With this I am only concerned here so
far as it illustrates the prevalence of a five-hide unit. Mr Little,
who holds that Maurer, followed by Dr Stubbs, has gone too far,
and that 'there is no proof of any general law or widely
prevalent custom which conferred on the owner of five hides pure and
simple the title, duties, and rights of a thegn',<a id="footnotetagid130" name="footnotetagid130"></a><a href="#footnoteid130"><sup>130</sup></a>
sets forth his view thus:</p>

<blockquote><p>
What then is the meaning of the frequent recurrence in the laws of
possession of five hides of land as the distinctive mark of a particular rank?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg 66]</span></p>

<p>An explanation may be hazarded: at the end of the seventh century it was
the normal and traditional holding of a royal <i>thegn</i>.... It is not too much to
infer from the parallelism of the two wergelds, that five hides formed also
the regular endowment of a Saxon king's thegn.<a id="footnotetagid131" name="footnotetagid131"></a><a href="#footnoteid131"><sup>131</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Dr Stubbs' views will be found in his <cite>Constitutional History</cite> (1874), i.
155-6, 190-2, and those of Gneist in his <cite>Constitutional History</cite> (1886),
i. 13, 90, 94. The latter writer follows Schmidt rather than Maurer,
but sums up his position in the words: 'Since under &AElig;lfred and his
successors every estate of five hides is reckoned in the militia system
as one heavy-armed man, the rank of a thane becomes the right (as
such) of a possessor of five hides.'</p>

<p>Lastly, it is an interesting and curious fact that we owe to the
five-hide unit such place-names as Fivehead, Somerset; Fifehead,
Dorset; Fifield, Oxon; Fifield and Fyfield, Wilts; Fyfield, Hants;
and Fyfield, Essex&mdash;all of them in Domesday 'Fifhide' or 'Fifehide'&mdash;as
well as Fyfield, Berks, which occurs in Domesday as 'Fivehide'.
Philologists will note the corruption and its bearing on the original
pronunciation.</p>

<p>To the probable antiquity and origin of the five-hide system I
must recur, after glancing at the evidence for the northern and
eastern districts of England.</p>

<h4>VII. THE SIX-CARUCATE UNIT<a name="page66a" id="page66a"></a></h4>

<p>The subject that I now approach is one of the highest interest. I
propose to adduce for my theory convincing corroborative evidence
by showing that the part which is played in the hidated district of
England by the five-hide unit is played in the Danish districts by a
unit of six carucates. In other words, where we look in the former for
'v. hid&aelig;', we must learn to look in the latter for 'vi. carucat&aelig;
terr&aelig;'.</p>

<p>One must dissociate at the outset this six-carucate unit from the
'long hundred', or <i>Angelicus numerus</i>, with which Mr Pell confused it.
In Mr Stevenson's instructive article on 'The Long Hundred and its
use in England',<a id="footnotetagid132" name="footnotetagid132"></a><a href="#footnoteid132"><sup>132</sup></a>
he has clearly explained that this reckoning only
applied to a whole hundred, which, if a 'long' hundred, was really
120. Any lesser number was reckoned in our usual manner. This is
seen at once in the test passage at Lincoln (D.B., i. 336<i>a</i>), where
1,150 houses are reckoned as 'novies centum et lxx.', because 'hic
numerus Anglice computatur, id est centum pro cxx'.<a id="footnotetagid133" name="footnotetagid133"></a><a href="#footnoteid133"><sup>133</sup></a>
The persistence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg 67]</span>
in Lincolnshire, of the long hundred is well shown in the
<i>Inquisitiones post mortem</i> on Robert de Ros, 1311, among those printed
by Mr Vincent.<a id="footnotetagid134" name="footnotetagid134"></a><a href="#footnoteid134"><sup>134</sup></a>
We there read of 'c. acre terra arrabilis per
majorem centenam que valent per annum lx. s. prec' acre vj. den.',
at Wyville and Hungerton (on the border of Leicestershire);
while at Claxby and Normanby (in the north of the county) we
have 'cc. acras per minorem centenam et valent c. s. prec' acre vj.
d.' Again, at Gedney (in the south-east), we have 'cc. acre terre
arrabilis per majus centum et valent per annum xxiiij. li'. prec'
acre ij. s. et iiij<sup>xx.</sup> acre prati et valet per annum viij. li., prec' acre
ij. s. Et cxiij. acre pasture per majus centum et valent per annum
ix. li. xix. s. vi. d. prec' acre xviij. d.' On the same property there
were due 'ccciiij<sup>xx.</sup> opera autumpnalia cum falcis, et valent xxxvj.
s. viij. d., prec' operis j. den.', so that these also were reckoned by the
long hundred.</p>

<p>Mr Stevenson was not aware of this evidence, but admitted that
as the Domesday passage refers to 'such a Danish stronghold as
Lincolnshire, it is not free from the suspicion of Danish influence'.
His own evidence from a sixteenth-century rental<a id="footnotetagid135" name="footnotetagid135"></a><a href="#footnoteid135"><sup>135</sup></a>
is subject to a
similar criticism. For the general use, therefore, of the 'long hundred'
in England he is compelled to rely on the <cite>Dialogus de Scaccario</cite> and
Howden's description of the new survey of 1198, the 'hide or ploughland'
being described in both cases as of a hundred acres, where the
'hundred' must have meant 120. But I venture to think that the use
of this reckoning for the ploughland, or archaic 'hide', does not
establish its general employment. In Domesday, certainly, it is
only at Lincoln that we find it actually recognized, houses being
reckoned everywhere else on the usual system.</p>

<p>I think, therefore, that we fairly may hold the <i>Anglicus numerus</i>, or
long hundred, to have specially prevailed in the 'Danish' districts,
which were also assessed, we shall find, in sums of six and twelve.
But what was the boundary of this Danish district? It was not the
border between Mercia and Wessex, for Mercia was itself divided
between the 'six' and the 'five' systems.<a id="footnotetagid136" name="footnotetagid136"></a><a href="#footnoteid136"><sup>136</sup></a>
Of the two adjacent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg 68]</span>
Mercian shires, for instance, of Leicester and Warwick (afterwards
united under one sheriff), we find the latter decimal and the former
duodecimal. The military service of Warwick and Leicester was
arranged on the same method, yet Leicester sent <em>twelve</em> 'burgesses'
to the fyrd where Warwick sent <em>ten</em>. But, it may be urged, the two
shires were divided by the Watling Street, the boundary (under the
peace of Wedmore) of Danelaw. Was then the Danelaw the district
within which the systems prevailed? No, for the Danelaw, under this
treaty, included all Cambridgeshire and other hidated districts. The
answer, therefore, which I propound is this: The district in which
men measured by carucates, and counted by twelves and sixes, was
not the district which the Danes <em>conquered</em>, but the district which the
Danes <em>settled</em>, the district of 'the Five Boroughs'.</p>

<p>Dependent on these 'Five Boroughs' were the four shires of
Leicester, Derby, Nottingham, and Lincoln. For two of the Boroughs,
Lincoln and Stamford, both belonged to this last shire, which was,
indeed, the stronghold of the system.<a id="footnotetagid137" name="footnotetagid137"></a><a href="#footnoteid137"><sup>137</sup></a>
Between Stamford and Cambridge
we have the same contrast as between Warwick and Leicester,
for while Cambridge was divided into <em>ten</em> wards ('custodi&aelig;'),
Stamford was divided into <em>six</em>. Lincolnshire, as I have said, was the
stronghold of the system, and it is in Lincoln itself that we find
Domesday alluding <i>eo nomine</i> to the <i>Anglicus numerus</i>, the practice
of counting 120 as 100.</p>

<p>Now in the peculiar district of which I am treating there occurs
an important formula which covers Lincolnshire, Yorkshire,
Derbyshire, and Notts. Domesday has nothing like it for the other
parts of England. Here are the three passages in which we find it
recorded:</p>

<p>For comparison with these three passages we may turn to the
charter of immunities confirmed to York Cathedral by Henry I,
Stephen, and Henry II. We there read:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Si quis enim quemlibet cujuscumque facinoris aut flagitii reum et convictum
infra atrium ecclesi&aelig; caperet et retineret, universali judicio vi.
<i>hundreth</i> emendabit; si vero infra ecclesiam xii. <i>hundreth</i> infra chorum xviii.
... <i>In hundreth</i> viii. <i>libr&aelig; continentur</i>.<a id="footnotetagid138" name="footnotetagid138"></a><a href="#footnoteid138"><sup>138</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>As there were <em>twelve</em> carucates in the 'Hundred', so it paid <em>twelve</em>
marcs, which, if we can trust the above explanation, themselves
came to be termed a 'Hundred'. Moreover, the 'Hundreds' themselves
were grouped in multiples of <em>six</em>. So too the Yorkshire thegn
who held <em>six</em> Manors or less paid three marcs to the sheriff; if he held
more than six, <em>twelve</em> marcs to the king (<cite>Domesday</cite>, i.
289<i>b</i>).</p>

<p>It is a special feature of the 'Danish' district that each territorial
'Hundred' contained twelve 'carucat&aelig; terr&aelig;'. This point is all-important.
Just as a 'Hundred' to an Anglo-Saxon suggested one
hundred 'hides', so to the Danes of this district it suggested twelve
'carucates'. Nay, to the men of Lincolnshire there could be no more
question that twelve carucates made a 'Hundred' than there could
be now, among ourselves that twelve pence make a shilling. If we
turn to the Lindsey Survey,<a id="footnotetagid139" name="footnotetagid139"></a><a href="#footnoteid139"><sup>139</sup></a>
a generation later than Domesday,
we obtain proof to that effect. We find that Survey, in three instances,
adding up all the estates of a tenant within a Wapentake, and giving
us the result in 'Hundreds' and 'carucates'. Here are the actual
figures:</p>

<p>Now we must observe that these 'Hundreds' are not <em>districts</em> with 'a
local habitation and a name'; they are merely sums of twelve
carucates produced by compound addition. We further find, at the
head of the survey of each Wapentake, a note that it is reckoned to
contain so many 'Hundreds', with the explanation, in some instances
that in each 'Hundred' were 'xii. carucat&aelig; terr&aelig;'.<a id="footnotetagid143" name="footnotetagid143"></a><a href="#footnoteid143"><sup>143</sup></a>
But even here
the real unit is shown to be 'six carucates', for several Wapentakes
contain an odd 'half-hundred', while in that of Horncastle this is
actually entered as 'six carucates'.</p>

<p>Here are the nineteen Wapentakes, with the number of Hundreds
assigned to each, and the number of 'carucat&aelig; terr&aelig;' that such
Hundreds would imply:</p>

<p>All the above, it will be seen, are multiples of the six-carucate unit.
That the aggregate of recorded 'carucat&aelig; terr&aelig;' appears to differ,
though slightly, from the totals here given only shows how vain is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg 71]</span>
argument that, because the recorded aggregates of Hundreds may
often be uneven figures, there could therefore have been no system
at work such as I contend there was. Clerical error and special
alterations have both to be allowed for.</p>

<p>It has never, so far as I know, been pointed out that these Lindsey
Trithings were so arranged as to contain an approximately equal
number of 'Hundreds'. So far as it is possible now to reckon them,
the South Trithing contained 51&frac12;, the North Trithing 51&frac12;, and the
West Trithing 49&frac12;. Fifty 'Hundreds' would represent 600 <i>carucat&aelig;</i>;
and it is, to say the least, a singular coincidence that, in the archaic
territorial list that has hitherto baffled investigation, the North
Gyrwa, South Gyrwa, and Spalda are reckoned each at 600
hides.<a id="footnotetagid145" name="footnotetagid145"></a><a href="#footnoteid145"><sup>145</sup></a></p>

<p>The Lindsey Survey would describe such a Wapentake as containing
'Seven Hundreds'.</p>

<p>Crossing the border from Lincolnshire into Rutland (<i>i.e.</i> the
Rutland of Domesday), we find the same system at work that meets
us in the Lindsey Survey. We read:</p>

<blockquote><p>
In Alfnodestou Wapent' sunt ii. Hundrez. In unoquoque [sunt] xii.
carucat&aelig; ad geldum.... In Martinesleie Wap' est i. hundret, in quo xii.
carucat&aelig; ad geldum.&mdash;<cite>D.B.</cite>, i. 293<i>b.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p>On analysing the contents of these Wapentakes, we find this
statement fully borne out, the former containing twenty-four, and
the latter twelve, 'carucat&aelig; terr&aelig;'. These are carefully contrasted
throughout with the 'terra caruc&aelig;' or areal measure.<a id="footnotetagid146" name="footnotetagid146"></a><a href="#footnoteid146"><sup>146</sup></a></p>

<p>In Yorkshire, Notts and Derby, we have less direct evidence.
Sawley, in Derbyshire, has indeed been alleged to be entered in
Domesday as a Hundred of twelve carucates, but Domesday does
not justify this assertion being made.<a id="footnotetagid147" name="footnotetagid147"></a><a href="#footnoteid147"><sup>147</sup></a>
I would rather trust to the
notable formula, which, as I explained at the outset, is common to
these counties for proof that they also were arranged in 'Hundreds'
of twelve carucates.</p>

<p>The prevalence, however, of assessment by sixes, threes, and
twelves, meets us on every side, as does, in hidated districts, the
assessments by fives and tens. At the outset, for instance, of the
survey of Yorkshire we have the district 'gelding' with the city
assessed at eighty-four (12&#215;7) carucates (which would be described
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg 74]</span>
in Lincolnshire as seven 'Hundreds'). We have two lists of the
details, which are given here.<a id="footnotetagid148" name="footnotetagid148"></a><a href="#footnoteid148"><sup>148</sup></a></p>

<p>These lists have a value independent of their illustration of the
arrangement in threes and sixes. They show how Domesday breaks
down, when it supplies a check upon its own evidence, by failing to
make its details agree with its total; and they further show by the
discrepancy between them how easily error may arise, and how
rash it must be to argue from a single case.<a id="footnotetagid149" name="footnotetagid149"></a><a href="#footnoteid149"><sup>149</sup></a></p>

<p>Yorkshire presents other traces, in its Hundreds, of the same
system. Thus the townships in the Hundred of 'Toreshou' follow
one another in this order: 18, 18, 20, 6, 18, 8, 12, 12 (8+4), 6, 18, 8,
18, etc. (<i>infra</i>, p. <a href="#page80">80</a>).</p>

<p>But my strong evidence is found in an invaluable survey of
Leicestershire, unknown till now to historians,<a id="footnotetagid150" name="footnotetagid150"></a><a href="#footnoteid150"><sup>150</sup></a>
which does for
the carucated districts just what the <cite>Inq. Com. Cant.</cite> does for the
hidated ones. Here we find the townships grouped in small blocks of
from six to twenty-four 'carucat&aelig; terr&aelig;', as a rule with almost
monotonous regularity. And these blocks are further combined in
small local Hundreds, of which the very existence is unknown to
historians and antiquaries,<a id="footnotetagid151" name="footnotetagid151"></a><a href="#footnoteid151"><sup>151</sup></a>
and which are usually multiples, like
the Lincolnshire Wapentake, of the six-carucate unit.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that in the case of Cambridgeshire, I
selected for my first two examples a Hundred of 50 hides, composed of
5 Vills assessed at 10 hides each, and a Hundred of 70 hides, composed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg 75]</span>
of 7 Vills, assessed at 10 hides each. In Leicestershire, precisely
in the same manner, I shall begin with the simplest forms and
select Hundreds of 36 and 48 carucates, composed of Vills uniformly
assessed at 12 carucates each.</p>

<p>With these types as clues we are in a position to assert that where
the total assessment of a Hundred varies but slightly from a multiple
of six, there must have been some slight error in one of the figures.
Thus Hundreds of 35&frac12;, 34<small><sup>13</sup></small>&frasl;<small>16</small> carucates, etc., may be safely assumed
to have been Hundreds of 36 carucates; those of 41, 43&#8542;, etc.,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg 76]</span>
would be of 42 carucates; those of 48&#8542;, 50, etc., would be of 48
carucates. These slight discrepancies, precisely as in Lincolnshire,
are accounted for by Vills of 6 or 12 carucates, being entered as of
5&#8542;, 5<small><sup>13</sup></small>&frasl;<small>16</small>, 6&frac34;, or 11&#8542;, 13, etc. Thus:</p>

<p>The most usual Leicestershire Hundreds are those of 36, 42, and
48 carucates, which, be it observed, would be described in the
language of the Lindsey Survey as 'Wapentakes' of 3, 3&frac12;, and 4
'Hundreds' respectively. The name may be different: the thing is
the same.<a id="footnotetagid152" name="footnotetagid152"></a><a href="#footnoteid152"><sup>152</sup></a></p>

<p>It will have been seen by this Survey that the 'Vills', single or
grouped, were assessed precisely as in Cambridgeshire, save that
there the assessment was reckoned in fives and tens, while here it
was in sixes and twelves.</p>

<h4>VIII. THE LEICESTERSHIRE 'HIDA'<a name="page76a" id="page76a"></a></h4>

<p>The case of Leicestershire introduces us to a very curious point.
Leicestershire is not one of those counties to which the singular
formula that I discussed above refers. This suggests that it was not
arranged in 'Hundreds' of twelve carucates. The above Survey
confirms this, for it shows us Hundreds resembling in character
those found in the hidated districts. But although the twelve-carucate
unit of the 'Hundred' is not found in Leicestershire, we do find in it a
group-unit, and that unit is the <i>hida</i>. Just as we have seen the
Hundred used in two wholly different senses, so also was the
'hida'. The quite peculiar way in which 'hida' occurs in Leicestershire
(which was not a hidated but carucated district) completely
baffled Mr Eyton, and was misunderstood by Mr Pell.<a id="footnotetagid153" name="footnotetagid153"></a><a href="#footnoteid153"><sup>153</sup></a>
Both writers failed to observe not only that the use of 'hida' is here of
a peculiar character, but also that the normal 'hida' of Domesday
(from which they could not emancipate themselves) would be
quite out of place in this carucated district.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg 77]</span></p>

<p>The first point to grasp is that this Leicestershire 'hida' was a
term which, locally I mean, explained itself. It is used at least a
dozen times in the Survey of Leicestershire without any mention of
its contents. Those contents must have been, therefore, familiar
and fixed. But what were those contents? Three incidental notices
enable us to determine them:</p>

<blockquote><p>
231 (<i>a</i>), 2: 'Ibi est i. hida et iiii<sup>ta.</sup> pars i. hid&aelig;. Ibi sunt xxii. car' terr&aelig;
et dimidia.'</p>

<p>236  (<i>a</i>), 1: 'II. partes unius hid&aelig;, id est xii. car' terr&aelig;.'</p>

<p>237 (<i>a</i>), 2: 'II. partes unius hid&aelig;, id est xii. car' terr&aelig;.'
</p></blockquote>

<p>Just as the 'Hundred' of Lincolnshire was a sum of twelve carucates,
so the 'Hide' of Leicestershire was a sum of <em>eighteen carucates</em>.<a id="footnotetagid154" name="footnotetagid154"></a><a href="#footnoteid154"><sup>154</sup></a>
Working in the light of this discovery (for as such I claim it), we
find that the other 'hides', thus interpreted, give us an aggregate
of 'carucates' obviously suitable to the recorded ploughlands.<a id="footnotetagid155" name="footnotetagid155"></a><a href="#footnoteid155"><sup>155</sup></a>
It may, however, be fairly asked why Domesday should speak in
one place of half a 'hide', and in another of nine 'carucates'; in
one place of a hide and a third, and in another of twenty-four
carucates. The answer is that the singular love of variety which
distinguishes Domesday in Cambridgeshire (as we saw) is at work
here also. For instance, two equal estates are thus described:
'Willelmus iiii. car' terr&aelig; et dimidiam et iii. bovatas, et Rogerus
iiii. car' terr&aelig; et vii. bovatas' (fo. 234<i>a</i>). The same instinct which led
the scribe to enter these seven bovates as half a carucate <em>plus</em> three
bovates, led him also to enter ten and a half carucates as half a hide
<em>plus</em> a carucate and a half (fo. 237<i>a</i>).</p>

<p>But to the rule I have established there is a single exception.
We read of 'Medeltone' in this shire: 'Ibi sunt vii. hid&aelig; et una
carucata terr&aelig; et una bovata. In unaquaque hida sunt xiiii. carucat&aelig;
terr&aelig; et dimidia' (fo. 235<i>b</i>). The actual formula employed is unique
for the shire, and the figures are specially given as an exception.
But, with singular perversity, Domesday students have always
been inclined to pitch upon the exceptions as representing the rule,
forgetting that it was precisely in exceptional cases that figures had
to be given. In normal cases they would have been superfluous.</p>

<p>Several years have elapsed since I wrote the above explanation,
but I have decided to publish it exactly as it originally stood. In the
meanwhile, however, Mr Stevenson has dealt with the subject in an
article on 'The Hundreds of Domesday: the Hundred of Land'
(1890).<a id="footnotetagid156" name="footnotetagid156"></a><a href="#footnoteid156"><sup>156</sup></a>
He has advanced the ingenious theory that the Leicestershire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg 78]</span>
'hida' was only a clerical error for H[undred], and that it was
really that 'Hundred' of <em>twelve</em> carucates which we meet with in the
Lindsey Survey. To prove this, he reads an entry on 236<i>a</i>, 1, as
'Ogerus Brito tenet in Cilebe de rege ii. partes unius hid&aelig;, id est xii.
car[ucat&aelig;] terr&aelig;', and claims that this gloss defines the 'hida' as a
'hundred' of twelve carucates. I confess that to me such a rendering
is in the highest degree non-natural. If we speak of 'two-thirds of a
yard, that is twenty-four inches', we should clearly imply that the
yard itself was thirty-six inches, not twenty-four. Similarly, I
claim to render the 'gloss' as implying that the 'hida' itself contained
eighteen carucat&aelig;, not twelve.<a id="footnotetagid157" name="footnotetagid157"></a><a href="#footnoteid157"><sup>157</sup></a>
If I am right, Mr Stevenson's suggestion
that this 'hida' was really a 'Hundred' also falls to the
ground.</p>

<p>After careful study of the Domesday Survey of Leicestershire, I
definitely hold that in that county 'carucata terr&aelig;' was the geld-carucate
and 'terra <i>x</i> car[ucis]' the actual ploughlands.<a id="footnotetagid158" name="footnotetagid158"></a><a href="#footnoteid158"><sup>158</sup></a>
Now there
are only three instances in which the Survey records the assessment
both in terms of the 'hida' and in 'carucat&aelig; terr&aelig;', and in all three
the figures support my own theory. The Abbot of Coventry's
Burbage estate (231<i>a</i>, 2), where a 'hide' and a quarter equates 22&frac12;
'carucat&aelig; terr&aelig;', is a test-case, and Mr Stevenson there takes refuge
in a suggested 'beneficial hidation'. The exact formula, no doubt, is
peculiar, but reference to the text shows that 's[un]t' has been interpolated
between 'ibi' and 'xxii.' I suspect that the scribe had
written 'ibi' (from the force of habit) when he ought to have
written 'id est'.</p>

<p>I close this portion of my essay by applying my own theory to the
case of 'Erendesbi' (Arnesby). The relative entries are:</p>

<blockquote><p>
'Episcopus Constantiensis tenet in Erendesber iii<sup>as.</sup> car[ucatas] terr&aelig; et
dim. et unam bovatam (231).'</p>

<p>'W[illelmus] Pevrel tenet dim. hidam et iii. bovatas terr&aelig; in Erendesbi
(235).'
</p></blockquote>

<p>Put into figures they work out:</p>

<h4>IX. THE LANCASHIRE 'HIDA'</h4>

<p>There is one other case of a peculiar 'hide' in Domesday. This is
that which is found in the land 'between Ribble and Mersey', that
district of which the description offers so many peculiarities. We
find it divided into six hundreds, and of the 'hides' in the first, that of
(West) Derby, we read: 'In unaquaque hida sunt vi. carucat&aelig;
terr&aelig;' (i. 269<i>b</i>). Whether or not that explanation applies, as is
believed, to the whole district, we have here again a 'Danish' place-name
brought into direct relation with the six-carucate unit. On
the opposite bank of the Mersey lay the Wirral peninsula, in which
this system of assessment cannot be traced.</p>

<p>Mr Green alluded to the Danish 'byes' as found, by exception,
'about Wirral in Cheshire',<a id="footnotetagid160" name="footnotetagid160"></a><a href="#footnoteid160"><sup>160</sup></a>
and held that Norsemen from the Isle
of Man had founded 'the little group of northern villages which we
find in the Cheshire peninsula of the Wirral'.<a id="footnotetagid161" name="footnotetagid161"></a><a href="#footnoteid161"><sup>161</sup></a>
I cannot find them
myself. In his 'Notes on the Domesday Survey, so far as it relates to
the Hundred of Wirral'<a id="footnotetagid162" name="footnotetagid162"></a><a href="#footnoteid162"><sup>162</sup></a>
(1893), Mr Fergusson Irvine, in a paper
which shows, though somewhat discursive, how much can only be
done by intelligent local research, has collated all the Domesday
entries. 'Raby' is the one place I can there find in the peninsula
with the 'bye' termination; while out of fifty-one entries twenty
refer to places with the English termination 'tone', and the Anglo-Saxon
test-words 'ham' and 'ford' are found in four others. There
were, doubtless, Norse elements in the peninsula, but they were not
strong enough to change the place-names or divide the land on their
own system. In the same way, Chester had its 'lawmen', though it
was not one of the Five Boroughs, nor is what I have termed the
Scandinavian formula applied to Cheshire in Domesday. So, too,
there were lawmen at Cambridge, and their heriot included eight
pounds,<a id="footnotetagid163" name="footnotetagid163"></a><a href="#footnoteid163"><sup>163</sup></a>
which occur in the above formula as the twelve marcs of
the Danish 'Hundred'. Yet the whole system of Cambridgeshire was
non-Danish. It was only, in short, where the northern invaders had
settled down as a people that they were strong enough to divide the
land anew and organize the whole assessment on their own system.</p>

<h4>X. THE YORKSHIRE UNIT<a name="page79a" id="page79a"></a></h4>

<p>We have seen that the unit of assessment for the carucated districts
of England was 'vi. carucat&aelig; terr&aelig;', just as five hides was the old
unit in the south. We have also seen that the former reckoning extended
over those districts which the Danish immigrants had
settled. There remains the question whether the Danes had merely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg 80]</span>
substituted six for five in the pre-existing arrangement, or had made
a wholly new one for themselves based on actual area.</p>

<p>It is <i>prim&acirc; facie</i> not probable that they can have adopted the
latter course, for the uniformity of their assessment proves its artificial
character. Yet, in his remarkable paper on 'The Ploughland and the
Plough',<a id="footnotetagid164" name="footnotetagid164"></a><a href="#footnoteid164"><sup>164</sup></a>
Canon Taylor has arrived at the conclusion that:</p>

<blockquote><p>
The geldable carucate of Domesday does not signify what the carucate
usually signifies in other early documents. The 'carucata ad geldum' is not
as commonly stated by Domesday commentators, the quantity of land
ploughed in each year by one plough, but it is the quantity tilled in one
year <em>in one arable field</em> by one plough.<a id="footnotetagid165" name="footnotetagid165"></a><a href="#footnoteid165"><sup>165</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>This 'novel and important proposition', as its author truly
described it, was probably the most notable contribution to our
knowledge that the Domesday Commemoration produced. The
Canon's theory, which (so far as his own East Riding is concerned)
he certainly seems to have established, is, at first sight, fatal to mine.
But, on the other hand, my own theory can be proved no less clearly
for Leicestershire, where the 'carucata terr&aelig;' and the ploughs are
often connected in about the same ratio as in Yorkshire.<a id="footnotetagid166" name="footnotetagid166"></a><a href="#footnoteid166"><sup>166</sup></a> This
leads us to inquire whether, even in the East Riding (where his
theory works best), we may not find traces of that assessment by the
six-carucate unit which I advocate myself. Such traces in Yorkshire
we have already seen,<a id="footnotetagid167" name="footnotetagid167"></a><a href="#footnoteid167"><sup>167</sup></a>
but there is other and stronger evidence.</p>

<p>If we take the modern Wapentake of Dickering (the first on
Canon Taylor's list) and examine its three Domesday Hundreds of
Turbar, Hunton, and Burton, we obtain these results:<a id="footnotetagid168" name="footnotetagid168"></a><a href="#footnoteid168"><sup>168</sup></a></p>

<p>The evidence of this last Hundred is so overwhelming that it cannot
be gainsaid.<a id="footnotetagid169" name="footnotetagid169"></a><a href="#footnoteid169"><sup>169</sup></a></p>

<p>I claim, therefore, that my theory holds good even in Canon
Taylor's stronghold, but I do so without venturing to dispute the
accuracy of his own. How far they can be reconciled I leave to
others to decide.</p>

<p>There are certain difficulties, however, which his brilliant suggestion
must raise. It is the essence of his theory that in a two-field
Manor the ploughland of 160 acres (half fallow) was assessed
at <em>one</em> 'carucata terr&aelig;', while in the three-field Manor the ploughland
of 180 acres (a third fallow) was assessed at <em>two</em>. This would be
an obvious and gross injustice. Again, remembering that, according
to the Canon, the proportion of 'carucat&aelig;' to ploughlands should be
either 2 to 1 or 1 to 1, what are we to make of such figures as these,
taken at a venture from a page of the Leicestershire Survey (232<i>a</i>, 1):</p>

<p>It is certainly difficult to discover any regular or consistent assessment
in a system where the ploughland was represented by anything
from &frac12; <i>carucata</i> to 2&frac14; <i>carucat&aelig;</i>. There is, however, in so many
cases an approximation to an assessment of three <i>carucat&aelig;</i> for two
ploughlands, that there seems to have been some underlying idea,
if we could only trace it out. But for this there is needed a special
investigation of all the carucated counties, a work of great labour and
requiring local co-operation. If we could have tables for each county,
arranged Hundred by Hundred and Vill by Vill, showing in
parallel columns the ploughland and the <i>carucat&aelig; ad geldum</i>, we
could then, and only then, venture to speak positively. Till that is
accomplished we are not in a position to explain how a system of
assessment, based on actual area, could result in aggregate assessments
uniformly expressed in terms of the six-carucate unit.</p>

<h4>XI. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS<a name="page82a" id="page82a"></a></h4>

<p>In seeking a clue to the origin of that artificial assessment, of which
the traces, whether more or less apparent, linger on the pages of
Domesday, I propose to exclude the carucated district, because we
require, as I have said, more complete evidence as to the system
pursued within it, and because, being associated with the settlement
of the Danes it represents a later introduction, while the very
name 'carucate', as I observed in <cite>Domesday Studies</cite>, has, unlike the
mysterious 'hide', an obvious connection with the ploughland.
Confining ourselves to the district assessed in terms of the 'hide',
we seek to learn the origin of the system by which, as I contend, it was
divided for the purpose of taxation into blocks, each of which was
expressed in terms of the five-hide unit.</p>

<p>Now if we follow the clue afforded by the Cambridgeshire evidence,
and hold that the assessment was originally laid not on
the Manor, nor even on the Vill, but on the Hundred as a whole,<a id="footnotetagid170" name="footnotetagid170"></a><a href="#footnoteid170"><sup>170</sup></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg 83]</span>
it might be suggested that the Hundred itself subdivided the amount
among its constituent elements. In practice, indeed, from the
nature of the case, this principle must have prevailed in every <em>town</em>
assessed at a Hundred or Half-Hundred, for where an urban
community was assessed in 'hides' the burgesses must, as in later
days, have settled among themselves the proportion to be borne by
individuals or individual properties. If, then, they were able to do
this, and if, as I hold, town and country were assessed on the same
principle, as part of the same system, what was to prevent their
neighbours, in the court of the rural Hundred, similarly distributing
among its constituents their respective shares of the common burden?</p>

<p>We might even be tempted to go far further than this, and to
carry our discoveries to a logical conclusion. If, as is asserted, direct
taxation ('geld') began in England with the need for raising money
to buy off the Danes, let us ask ourselves how the Witan would
proceed when confronted with a demand, let us say, for &pound;10,000.
As there had been hitherto, <i>ex hypothesi</i>, no direct taxation, there
would be no statistical information at their disposal, enabling
them to raise by a direct levy the sum required. Their only possible
resource, we might hold, would be to apportionate it in round sums
among the contributory shires. Proceeding on precisely the same
lines, the county court, in its turn, would distribute the <i>quota</i> of
the shire among its constituent Hundreds, and the Hundred court
would then assign to each Vill its share. As the Vills were represented
in the Hundred court, and the Hundreds in the Shire court,
the just apportionment of the Shire's <i>quota</i> would be thus practically
secured. The arrangement would, moreover, be as satisfactory to
the Witan as it was fair to the contributors <i>inter se</i>; for, by this
gradation of responsibility, the payment of the whole was absolutely
secured. This explanation is very tempting, and, indeed, such a
system of apportioning liability is to be traced from time immemorial
in the Indian village community.<a id="footnotetagid171" name="footnotetagid171"></a><a href="#footnoteid171"><sup>171</sup></a>
Moreover, if the ratio
of 'hides' to ploughlands were found to vary to any marked extent,
according to county, the hypothesis that the quota, in the first
instance, was laid upon each county would duly explain the ratio
assessment being higher or lower in one county than in another.</p>

<p>But such an hypothesis would imply that this assessment dated only
from the days of &AElig;thelred, or <i>circ.</i> 1000. Now the five-hide unit, on
the contrary, was undoubtedly an old institution. Church lordships,
the easiest to trace, appear to have retained their hidation unchanged
from early times, and the 'possessio decem familiarum' of
Bede seems to carry the decimal system back to very early days.
Mr Seebohm, indeed&mdash;though, like others, he had failed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg 84]</span>
discover the existence of the five-hide system&mdash;saw in this 'possessio'
of Bede a connecting link with the Roman <i>decuria</i>, just as he saw in
the Roman <i>jugatio</i> the possible origin of English hidation. And we
must, of course, trace its artificial arrangement (1) either to the
Romans, (2) or to the Britons&mdash;assuming them to have had the
same system as existed in Wales for the food-rents, (3) or to the
English invaders.</p>

<p>Arrested at this point by the difficulty of assigning to the system I
have described its real origin, I dropped these studies for some
years in the hope that there might come from some quarter fresh
light upon the problem. As I cannot, however, for lack of evidence,
propound a solution capable of proof, I will content myself with
indicating the line of research that offers, I venture to think, the
most likelihood of success.</p>

<p>The proportionate sums contributed by the several counties to the
Danegeld present a fruitful field of inquiry, but one, it would seem,
as yet unworked. Mr Eyton, it is true, observed that 'in Devon and
Cornwall the scope of the gheld-hide was enormous',<a id="footnotetagid172" name="footnotetagid172"></a><a href="#footnoteid172"><sup>172</sup></a>
that is, in
other words, the assessment was strangely low, but it did not occur
to him to seek the cause of the phenomenon he observed. If, as was
the case, West Wales was assessed on quite a different scale to the
counties adjoining it on the east, it may suggest a conclusion no less
important than that, when the latter were originally assessed, West
Wales was not yet a portion of the English realm. But, before concluding
that the hide assessment is proved to be as ancient as this,
we must see whether it is possible to detect any principle at work in
the total assessments of the several counties, any relation between
their area and the sums they contributed to the geld as entered in
the Pipe Roll of 1130, our first evidence on the subject.</p>

<p>For such an enquiry it is especially needful to insist on breadth of
treatment. In the first place, the modern area of the counties
may vary more or less from the original extent;<a id="footnotetagid173" name="footnotetagid173"></a><a href="#footnoteid173"><sup>173</sup></a>
in the second
we have no proof that the assessment had always been the same,
though the tendency in early days, no doubt, was to stereotype such
figures. We must not, therefore attempt close or detailed investigation
but if, on a review of the whole evidence, we detect certain
broad features, uneffaced by the hand of time, we may fairly
claim that we have in these the traces of a principle at work, the
witness to a state of things prevailing in the distant past.</p>

<p>On comparing the contributions to a 'geld' at two shillings on the
hide with the (modern) area of counties, we find that a rate of
about a pound for every seven square miles prevailed widely
enough to be almost described as normal.</p>

<p>It is remarkable, not only for this agreement <i>inter se</i>, but also for the
sharp contrast it presents to the groups of counties, lying respectively
to the south-east and the north-west of it. The former approximates
a rate twice as high, namely, <em>two</em>-sevenths of a pound to the square
mile:</p>

<p>Taking this group as a whole, it paid &pound;1,032 18s 1d, a curiously
close approximation to the &pound;1,021<small><sup>4</sup></small>&frasl;<small>7</small> which my suggested rate of <small><sup>2</sup></small>&frasl;<small>7</small>
would give. Middlesex was so exceptional a county, that one hardly
likes to include it, but there also the rate was a little over two-sevenths.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the counties to the north-west of what I
have termed the Midland group are assessed at a rate singularly
low. Nottingham and Derby, with a joint area of 1,855 miles,
contributed only &pound;108 8s 6d, representing one-seventeenth;<a id="footnotetagid174" name="footnotetagid174"></a><a href="#footnoteid174"><sup>174</sup></a>
while Staffordshire, with its 1,169 miles, is found paying &pound;44 0s 11d,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg 86]</span>
a rate scarcely more than one twenty-seventh. Passing to the
opposite corner of the realm, we have Kent, always a wealthy
county, assessed at the phenomenally low rate of about one-fifteenth
(&pound;105 2s 10d, as against 1,555 miles), rather less than half
that of Essex to its north, and Sussex to its west.</p>

<p>It would seem impossible to resist the conclusion that in these
widely differing rates we have traces of a polity as yet divided, of
those independent kingdoms from which had been formed the realm.
Kent, for instance, which had so steadily maintained, first, its
independent existence, and then its local institutions, had succeeded
in preserving an assessment that its neighbours had cause to
envy. In the west, Cornwall similarly enjoyed a low, indeed a
nominal assessment while that of Devon, though higher than this,
was so significantly lower than those of Somerset and Dorset<a id="footnotetagid175" name="footnotetagid175"></a><a href="#footnoteid175"><sup>175</sup></a>
as to remind us that here, in part at least, the 'Welsh' long held
their own. If the incidence of geld were shown by shading a map of
England, on the plan so successfully adopted in Mr Seebohm's
great work, it would show that the heavily assessed counties were
those which formed the nucleus of the old West-Saxon realm.<a id="footnotetagid176" name="footnotetagid176"></a><a href="#footnoteid176"><sup>176</sup></a>
All round this nucleus the map would shade off sharply, another
sudden change marking the Danish counties on the north, the
Jutish kingdom on the east, and the British district in the south-west.
It is, perhaps, worthy of remark that Shropshire was assessed
twice as heavily as the adjoining county of Stafford, possibly because
part of it was added, at a very early period, to the kingdom of the
West Saxons. If Mr Eyton was right in his reckoning that Kesteven
was assessed twice as heavily as Lindsey, and Lindsey, in turn,
twice as heavily as Holland, it would illustrate the survival of local
distinctions even within the compass of a modern county, as well as
the 'shading off' tendency of which I have already spoken.</p>

<p>The point I have here endeavoured to bring out is that if the
system of artificial assessment were of Roman or British origin,
we should expect to find it fairly uniform over the whole country,
whereas we find, on the contrary, the very widest discrepancies. It
might be urged, perhaps, that these were due to the differing conditions
of particular counties, to their more or less partial reclamation,
for instance, of the date when they were assessed. But this
would not account for the grouping I have traced, and would
imply that each county ought to differ indefinitely. Nor would it
explain the case of Kent, where a county that must have been foremost
in early development and prosperity enjoyed a phenomenally
low assessment.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg 87]</span></p>

<p>Another objection that may be raised to my hypothesis is that the
Hundred, as an area for police and rating, was a comparatively
late institution, and that if the artificial system of assessment were
as ancient as I suggest, it could not have operated, as we saw, in
Cambridgeshire, it did operate, through the 'Hundred'. It is, however,
admitted that the <em>thing</em> represented by the 'Hundred' was, whatever
its original name, of immemorial antiquity, as the intermediate
division between the Vill and the Shire or kingdom.
Approaching the subject from the legal standpoint, Professor
Maitland has pointed out that the Hundred having a proper court,
which the Vill had not, was the older institution of the two, and
has skilfully seized on the differentiation of villages originally
possessing one name in common as a hint that some such subdivision
may have been going on more widely than is known. It
seems to me to be at least possible that the district originally
representing a Hundred, and named, as we are learning, in most
cases from the primitive meeting-place of its settlers, was reckoned as
so many multiples of five or ten hides, and that this aggregate was
subsequently distributed by its community among themselves.<a id="footnotetagid177" name="footnotetagid177"></a><a href="#footnoteid177"><sup>177</sup></a></p>

<p>If it be not presumption to touch on the controversies as to the
Hundred,<a id="footnotetagid178" name="footnotetagid178"></a><a href="#footnoteid178"><sup>178</sup></a>
I would suggest that while agreeing with Dr Stubbs,
that the name of 'Hundred' may be traced to the ordinance of
Edgar<a id="footnotetagid179" name="footnotetagid179"></a><a href="#footnoteid179"><sup>179</sup></a>
&mdash;which did not, however, create the district itself&mdash;I
cannot reconcile it with the view to which he leans in his <cite>Constitutional
History</cite>, that 'under the name of geographical hundreds we have the
variously sized <i>pagi</i> or districts in which the hundred warriors
settled'; and that we should 'recognize in the name the vestige of the
primitive settlement, and in the district itself an earlier or a later
subdivision of the kingdom to which it belonged'.<a id="footnotetagid180" name="footnotetagid180"></a><a href="#footnoteid180"><sup>180</sup></a>
For my part, I have never been able to understand the anxiety to identify the
district known, in later days, as a 'Hundred' with an original
hundred warriors, families, or hides. The significant remark on the
'centeni' by Tacitus, that 'quod primo numerus fuit, jam nomen et
honor est', would surely lead us to expect that by the time of the
migration the 'Hundred' had become, like the 'hide' of Domesday, a
term even more at variance with fact. Indeed, in his masterly
'Introductory sketch', Dr Stubbs observed that the 'superior
divisions' made by the 'new-comers' would 'have that indefiniteness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg 88]</span>
which even in the days of Tacitus belonged to the Hundreds, the
<i>centeni</i> of the Germans', and that their 'system' would be 'transported
whole, at the point of development which it has reached at
home'.<a id="footnotetagid181" name="footnotetagid181"></a><a href="#footnoteid181"><sup>181</sup></a></p>

<p>The suggestion I have made as to the origin of the five-hide system
is tentative only, and must remain so until we have at our disposal
for the whole hidated region that complete and trustworthy analysis
of assessment, on the need of which I again insist, at the risk of
wearisome iteration.</p>

<h4>XII. THE EAST ANGLIAN 'LEET'<a name="page88a" id="page88a"></a></h4>

<p>In Norfolk and Suffolk we find Domesday recording assessed
values not, as everywhere else, at the outset of an entry, but at its
close; not in terms of hides and carucates, but in terms of shillings
and pence. Instead of saying that a Manor paid on so many 'hid&aelig;'
or 'carucat&aelig; terr&aelig;', Domesday, in the case of these counties,
normally employs the phrase: '<i>x</i> denarii de gelto'. Its meaning is
that to every <em>pound</em> paid by the Hundred as geld the Manor contributed
<i>x</i> pence.<a id="footnotetagid182" name="footnotetagid182"></a><a href="#footnoteid182"><sup>182</sup></a>
Thus, in the case of a Hundred assessed at a
hundred hides, the formula for a five-hide Manor would be here
'xii. denarii de gelto', instead of the usual 'defendit se pro v. hidis',
or some such phrase as that. There is an exact parallel to this method
of recording assessed values in the case of fractions of knights' fees
where portions of land are entered as paying so much 'when the
scutage is forty shillings', instead of being assessed in terms of the
knight's fee.<a id="footnotetagid183" name="footnotetagid183"></a><a href="#footnoteid183"><sup>183</sup></a>
This system would seem, however, to have been
understood imperfectly if at all. I may, therefore, point out that its
nature is clear from the case of the Suffolk Hundred of Thingoe.</p>

<p>The case of this Hundred is singularly instructive. We find its
twenty 'Vills' grouped in <em>blocks</em>, precisely as in the Cambridgeshire
Hundreds, and these blocks are all <em>equal units of assessment</em>, like the
ten-hide groups of the hidated districts. But in this case we can go
further still, for we are not dependent on Domesday alone. The portion
of a special Survey executed about a century later (<i>circ.</i> 1185)
for Abbot Sampson of St Edmund's, which relates to its Hundred, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg 89]</span>
fortunately preserved, and gives us the name of the twelve 'leets' into
which this Hundred was divided.<a id="footnotetagid184" name="footnotetagid184"></a><a href="#footnoteid184"><sup>184</sup></a></p>

<p>Here are the divisions recorded in it, with the Domesday assessment
(in pence) of each Vill placed against its name.</p>

<p>The two records&mdash;Domesday and the Inquest&mdash;thus confirm one
another, and their concurrent testimony establishes the fact not only
that the Suffolk Hundred was divided into blocks of equal
assessment, but that these blocks were known by the name of
'leets'.</p>

<p>Now Professor Maitland, in his Dissertation on the 'History of the
Word Leet',<a id="footnotetagid185" name="footnotetagid185"></a><a href="#footnoteid185"><sup>185</sup></a>
pronounces this 'the earliest occurrence of the
word' that he has seen. But I can carry it back to Domesday itself.
Though not entered in the <cite>Index Rerum</cite>, we find it in such instances as
these:</p>

<blockquote><p>
'H[undredum] de Grenehou de xiv. letis' (ii. 119<i>b</i>).</p>

<p>'Hund[redum] et dim[idium] de Clakelosa de x. leitis' (ii. 212<i>b</i>).
</p></blockquote>

<p>I think it probable that in these cases the entry happened to stand
first on the original return for the Hundred, and so&mdash;as in the I.E.,
where it is derived from the original returns&mdash;the general heading
crept in. Though Professor Maitland has to leave the origin of the
word unexplained, it seems to me impossible to overlook the analogy
between the Danish <i>l&aelig;gd</i>, described by Dr Skeat as a division of the
country (in Denmark) for military conscription,<a id="footnotetagid186" name="footnotetagid186"></a><a href="#footnoteid186"><sup>186</sup></a>
and the East Anglian <i>leet</i>, a division of the country (as we have seen) for purposes
of taxation.</p>

<p>Sudbury, it will be observed, was <em>a quarter</em> of the Hundred of
Thingoe,<a id="footnotetagid187" name="footnotetagid187"></a><a href="#footnoteid187"><sup>187</sup></a>
just as Huntingdon was a quarter of a Hundred,<a id="footnotetagid188" name="footnotetagid188"></a><a href="#footnoteid188"><sup>188</sup></a>
and Wisbech a quarter of a Hundred.<a id="footnotetagid189" name="footnotetagid189"></a><a href="#footnoteid189"><sup>189</sup></a></p>

<p>Having thus obtained from the Hundred of Thingoe the clue to
this peculiar system, we can advance to more difficult types. The
Hundred of Thedwastre, for instance, was divided not into twelve
blocks, each paying twenty pence in the pound, but into nine blocks,
each paying twenty-seven. This assessment allowed a margin of 3d
for every pound (i.e. &pound;1 0s 3d); but in the case of Thedwastre the
total excess was only 1&frac12;d on the pound (i.e. &pound;1 0s 1&frac12;d). I group the
Vills <em>tentatively</em>, thus:</p>

<p>The same unit of 27 (x9)&mdash;or, which comes to the same thing,
13&frac12; (x18)&mdash;was adopted in Risbridge Hundred. In this case no less
than five Manors are assessed at the same unit&mdash;13&frac12;d. So, again, in
the Hundred of Blackbourn the units are 34&frac12;d and 17&frac14;d, one
Manor being assessed at the former, and five at the latter sum. Such
is the key to the peculiar system of East Anglian assessment.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that 'twenty shillings'<a id="footnotetagid190" name="footnotetagid190"></a><a href="#footnoteid190"><sup>190</sup></a>
represents ten hides at
two shillings on the hide (the normal Danegeld rate), and thus suggests
that in Norfolk, as in Cambridgeshire, the Hundreds were
normally assessed in multiples of ten hides. The point, however, that
I want to bring out is that the Hundred, not the Manor, nor even
the Vill, is here treated as 'the fiscal unit for the collection of
Danegeld'.<a id="footnotetagid191" name="footnotetagid191"></a><a href="#footnoteid191"><sup>191</sup></a></p>

<h4>XIII. THE WORDS 'SOLINUM' AND 'SOLANDA'<a name="page91a" id="page91a"></a><a id="footnotetagid192" name="footnotetagid192"></a><a href="#footnoteid192"><sup>192</sup></a></h4>

<p>Several years ago I arrived at the conclusion that the identity of
these two words was an unsupported conjecture. So long as it
remained a conjecture only, its correction was not urgent; but since
then, as is so often the case, the result of leaving it unassailed has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg 92]</span>
that arguments are based upon it. There appeared in the <cite>English
Historical Review</cite> for July 1892 a paper by Mr Seebohm, in which
that distinguished scholar took the identity for granted, as his no less
distinguished opponent, Professor Vinogradoff, has done in his
masterly work on <cite>Villainage in England</cite>.</p>

<p>I believe the alleged identity was first asserted by Archdeacon
Hale, who wrote in his <cite>Domesday of St. Paul's</cite> (1858), p. xiv:</p>

<blockquote><p>
The word <i>solanda</i>, or, as it is written at p. 142, <i>scolanda</i>, is so evidently
a Latinized form of the Anglo-Saxon <i>sulung</i>, or ploughland, and approaches
so near to the Kentish <i>solinus</i>, that we need scarcely hesitate to consider
them identical.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Let us start from the facts. In the Domesday of Kent we find the
form <i>solin</i>, or its Latin equivalent <i>solinum</i>, used for the unit of
assessment,
like the hide and the carucate in other counties. In the Kent
monastic surveys it is found as <i>sullung</i> or <i>suolinga</i>. But when we
turn to
the Domesday of St. Paul's, we find&mdash;first, that instead of being
universal, as in Kent, it occurs only in three cases; secondly, that the
form is <i>solande</i>, <i>solanda</i>, <i>scholanda</i>, <i>scolanda</i>, or
even (we shall see) <i>Scotlande</i>; thirdly, that it is not employed as a unit of assessment at
all.</p>

<p>The three places where the term occurs in the Domesday of St.
Paul's are Drayton and Sutton in Middlesex, and Tillingham in
Essex. Hale would seem to have arrived at no clear idea of what the
word meant. At p. xiv he wrote that 'a <i>solanda</i> consisted of two hides,
but probably in this case the hide was not of the ordinary dimension'.
At p. lxxviii he inferred, from a reference to 'la Scoland' in a survey
of Drayton, that '"ploughed land" would seem to be opposed to
"Scoland"'. At p. cx he was led by the important passage&mdash;'De
hydis hiis decem, due fuerunt in dominio, una in scolanda, et vii.
assis&aelig;'&mdash;to suggest that it 'appears to denote some difference in the
tenure'. This last conjecture seems the most probable. If we take the
case of Sutton and Chiswick, we read in the survey of 1222:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Juratores dicunt quod manerium istud defendit se versus regem pro tribus
hidis preter solandam de Chesewich que per se habet duas hidas, et sunt
geldabiles cum hidis de Sutton.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Hale (p. 119) believed that this <i>Solande de Chesewich</i> was no other than
the <i>Scotlande thesaurarii</i> of 1181, namely the prebend of Chiswick.
The above passage should further be compared with the survey of
Caddington (1222):</p>

<blockquote><p>
Dicunt juratores quod manerium istud defendit se versus regem pro x.
hidis ... preter duas prebendas qu&aelig; sunt in eadem parochia.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The formula is the same in both cases, and a <i>solanda</i> was clearly land
held on some special terms, and was not a measure or unit of assessment
at all. Indeed Hale himself admitted that it could not be
identified with one or with two hides.</p>

<p>Fortunately I have discovered an occurrence of the word <i>solanda</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg 93]</span>
which conclusively proves that it meant an estate, such as a prebend,
and was not a unit of measurement. We have, in 1183, a 'grant by
William de Belmes, canon of St. Paul's, to the chapter of that church,
of the Church of St. Pancras, situate in his <i>solanda</i> near London'
(i.e. his prebend of St. Pancras), etc.<a id="footnotetagid193" name="footnotetagid193"></a><a href="#footnoteid193"><sup>193</sup></a>
This solves the mystery. The
three <i>soland&aelig;</i> at Tillingham were no other than the three
prebends&mdash;Ealdland, Weldland, and Reculverland&mdash;which that parish actually
contained.<a id="footnotetagid194" name="footnotetagid194"></a><a href="#footnoteid194"><sup>194</sup></a></p>

<p>Hale, however, misled Mr Seebohm, who in his great work on the
<cite>English Village Community</cite> (p. 54), wrote of Tillingham:</p>

<blockquote><p>
There was further in this Manor a <em>double hide</em>, called a <i>solanda</i>, presumably
of 240 acres. This double hide, called a <i>solanda</i>, is also mentioned in a Manor
in Middlesex [Sutton], and in another in Surrey [Drayton]<a id="footnotetagid195" name="footnotetagid195"></a><a href="#footnoteid195"><sup>195</sup></a>;
and the term <i>solanda</i> is probably the same as the well-known '<i>Sollung</i>' or '<i>solin</i>' of
Kent, meaning a 'ploughland'.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Proceeding further (p. 395), Mr Seebohm wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Generally in Kent, and sometimes in Sussex, Berks and Essex, we found,
in addition to, or instead of, the hide or carucate, or 'terra unius aratri',
<i>solins</i>, <i>sullungs</i>, or <i>swullungs</i>, the land pertaining to a '<i>suhl</i>', the Anglo-Saxon
word for plough.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately no reference is given for the cases of Sussex and
Berks, and I know of none myself.</p>

<p>Turning now to the learned work of Professor Vinogradoff, we find
him equally misled:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Of the <i>sulung</i> I have spoken already. It is a full ploughland, and 200 acres
are commonly reckoned to belong to it. The name is sometimes found out of
Kent, in Essex for instance. In Tillingham, a Manor of St. Paul's, of
London, we come across six hides 'trium solandarum'. The most probable
explanation seems to be that the hide or unit of assessment is contrasted with
the <i>solanda</i> or <i>sulland</i><a id="footnotetagid196" name="footnotetagid196"></a><a href="#footnoteid196"><sup>196</sup></a>
(sulung), that is with the actual ploughland, and
two hides are reckoned as a single <i>solanda</i> (p. 255).
</p></blockquote>

<p>Lastly, we come to Mr Seebohm's reply to Professor Vinogradoff
(<i>ante</i>, pp. 444-465). Here the identity is again assumed:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Along with parts of Essex, the Kentish records differ in phraseology from
those of the rest of England. Their <i>sullungs</i> of 240 acres occur also in the
Manors of Essex belonging to St. Paul's, and the custom of gavelkind and
succession of the youngest child mark it off as exceptional. Mr Vinogradoff
... shows that in the Kentish district, and in Essex, where the <i>sullung</i> or
<i>solanda</i> takes the place of the hide, and where gavelkind prevailed, the unity
of the hides and virgates was preserved only for the purposes of taxation and
the services; whilst in reality the holdings clustered under the nominal unit
were many and irregular.
</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg 94]</span></p>

<p>I yield to no one in admiration for Mr Seebohm's work, but the
question raised is so important that accuracy as to the fact is here
essential. (1) <i>Sullung</i> is nowhere found in Essex, but only <i>solanda</i>;
(2) <i>Solanda</i> does not occur 'in the Manors' referred to, but at
Tillingham alone; (3) In Essex it nowhere 'takes the places of the
hide', as it does in Kent; (4) The Essex instance adduced by Professor
Vinogradoff is taken from a Manor where <i>solanda</i> does not occur.</p>

<p>Two issues&mdash;quite distinct&mdash;are involved. In the first place, Mr
Seebohm contends that Professor Vinogradoff must not argue from
'the custom of Kent' to the rest of England, because (<i>inter alia</i>) Kent,
unlike the rest of England, was divided into <i>sulungs</i>, which points to
some difference in its organization.<a id="footnotetagid197" name="footnotetagid197"></a><a href="#footnoteid197"><sup>197</sup></a>
This contention is sound, and
is actually strengthened if we reject the identity of <i>sulung</i> and <i>solanda</i>.
But, in the second place, he endeavours to explain away the Essex
case of subdivision at Eadwulfsness, to which the Professor appeals,
by connecting it with the Kentish system through the term <i>solanda</i>.
This, as I have shown above, is based on a misreading of the evidence,
and is contrary to the facts of the case.</p>

<p>Let us then look more closely at the Essex instance of subdivision.
It is taken from one Manor alone, the great 'soke' of Eadwulfsness,
in the north-east corner of the county. This 'soke' comprised the
townships of Thorpe 'le soken', Kirby 'le soken', and Walton 'le
soken' (better known as Walton-on-the-Naze). Such names proclaim
the Danish origin of the community, and it is noteworthy that the
'hidarii', on whom the argument turns, are found only at Thorpe
and Kirby, the very two townships which bear Danish names. This
circumstance points to quite another track. That the system in this
little corner of Essex was wholly peculiar had been pointed out by
Hale, and it might perhaps have originated in the superimposition of
hides on a previous system, instead of in the breaking up of the hide
and virgate system. But this is only a conjecture. The two facts on
which I would lay stress are that at Thorpe, according to Hale, 'the
holders of the nine hides (in 1279) possessed also among them
seventy-two messuages', which, by its proportion of eight to the hide,
favours Mr Seebohm's views; and that the holdings of the 'hidarii'
were rigidly formed on the decimal system (such as 60, 30, 15,
7&frac12; acres, or 40, 20, 10, 5 acres),<a id="footnotetagid198" name="footnotetagid198"></a><a href="#footnoteid198"><sup>198</sup></a>
unlike the holdings of an odd
number of acres on the Kentish Manors of St. Augustine's. The
reason for the Essex system was clearly the necessity of keeping the
holdings in a fixed relation to the hide, that their proportion of the
hide's service might be easily determined. These two points have,
perhaps, I think, been overlooked by both of the eminent scholars in
their controversy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg 95]</span></p>

<p>Before leaving the subject of the <i>sulung</i>, one should mention
perhaps that it was divided (as Mr Seebohm has explained) into four
quarters known as <i>juga</i>, just as the hide was divided into four virgates.
Mr Seebohm bases this statement on Anglo-Saxon evidence,<a id="footnotetagid199" name="footnotetagid199"></a><a href="#footnoteid199"><sup>199</sup></a>
but it is abundantly confirmed by Domesday, where we read of Eastwell
(in Kent): 'pro uno solin se defendit. Tria juga sunt infra divisionem
Hugonis, et quartum jugum est extra' (i. 13). So far all is clear; but
Professor Vinogradoff, on the contrary, asserts that 'the yokes (<i>juga</i>)
of Battle Abbey (in Kent) are not virgates, but carucates, full
ploughlands' (p. 225). This assertion is based on a very natural
misapprehension.
In the Battle Manor of Wye (Kent) we find that the
<i>jugum</i> itself was divided into four quarters, called 'virgates' which
were each, consequently, the sixteenth, not, as in the hidated district,
the fourth of a ploughland. Professor Vinogradoff, naturally assuming
that the 'virgate' meant the same here as elsewhere, inferred that
four 'virgates' (that is, a <i>jugum</i>) must constitute a full ploughland.
But this change of denotation goes further still. The Battle Cartulary
records yet another 'virgate', namely, the fourth (not of a ploughland,
but) of an acre! This led me, on its publication, to wonder
whether we have here the clue to the origin of the somewhat
mysterious term 'virgate'. Starting from the acre, we should have
in the <i>virgata</i> (rood) its quarter, with a name derived from the
<i>virga</i>
(rod) which formed its base in mensuration. The sense of 'quarter'
once established, it might be transferred to the quarter of a <i>jugum</i>, or
the quarter of a hide. This is a suggestion which, of course, I advance
with all diffidence, but which would solve an otherwise insoluble
problem. The relation of the bovate to the carucate, and of the
<i>jugum</i> to the <i>sulung</i>, are both so obviously based upon the unit of
the
plough-team that they raise no difficulty. But the term 'virgate' does
not, like them, speak for itself. If we might take it to denote merely a
'quarter' of the hide, it would become a term of relation only, leaving
the 'hide' as the original unit. Should this suggestion meet with
acceptance, it might obviously lead to rather important results.</p>

<p>Mr Elton, in his well-known <cite>Tenures of Kent</cite>, attaches considerable
importance to a list, 'De Suylingis Comitatus Kanci&aelig; et qui eas
tenent', in the Cottonian MS., Claud. C. IV, which he placed little
subsequent to Domesday. Having transcribed it for collation with
the Survey, I came to the conclusion that it was not sufficiently
trustworthy for publication, for the names, in my opinion, involve
some anachronism. The feature of the list is that it shows us as
tenants-in-chief, the leading tenants of Bishop Odo; and the change
of most interest to genealogists is the succession of Patrick 'de
Caurcio' to the holding of Ernulf de Hesdin.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg 96]</span></p>

<h4>XIV. THE 'FIRMA UNIUS NOCTIS'</h4>

<p>The curious and evidently archaic institution of the <i>firma unius
noctis</i> was clearly connected with the problem of hidation. In
Somerset the formula for a Manor contributing to this <i>firma</i> was:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Nunquam geldavit nec scitur quot hid&aelig; sint ibi (i. 85).
</p></blockquote>

<p>In Dorset it ran:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Nescitur quot hid&aelig; sint ibi quia non geldabat T.R.E. (i. 75).
</p></blockquote>

<p>In Wiltshire we read:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Nunquam geldavit nec hidata fuit, <i>or</i> nunquam geldavit: ideo nescitur
quot hid&aelig; sint ibi.<a id="footnotetagid200" name="footnotetagid200"></a><a href="#footnoteid200"><sup>200</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>In all these entries the 'hide' is recognized as merely a measure of
assessment quite independent of area.</p>

<p>Hampshire affords us, in a group of Manors, a peculiarly good
instance in point. Of Basingstoke, Kingsclere, and 'Esseborne', we
read:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Rex tenet in dominio <i>Basingestoches</i>. Regale manerium fuit semper.
Numquam geldum dedit, nec hida ibi distributa fuit....</p>

<p><i>Clere</i> tenet rex in dominio. De firma Regis Edwardi fuit, et pertinet ad
firmam diei de Basingestoches. Numerum hidarum nescierunt....</p>

<p><i>Esseborne</i> tenet rex in dominio. De firma Regis Edwardi fuit. Numerum
hidarum non habent....</p>

<p>H&aelig;c tria maneria, Basingestoches, Clere, Esseborne, reddunt firmam
unius diei (39).
</p></blockquote>

<p>Other Manors are found about the county displaying the same
peculiarity.</p>

<blockquote><p>
Ipse rex tenet <i>Bertune</i>. De firm&acirc; Regis E. fuit, et dimidiam diem firm&aelig;
reddidit in omnibus rebus.... Nunquam in hid(is) numeratum fuit....
Numerum hidarum non dixerunt.</p>

<p>Ipse rex tenet <i>Edlinges</i> in dominio. Hoc manerium reddidit dimidiam
diem firm&aelig; tempore Regis E. Numerum hidarum nesciunt (38).
</p></blockquote>

<p>Manors, such as Andover, not hidated, clearly belonged to the same
system, though neither their value nor their render is given.</p>

<p>Thus, then, within the limits of Wessex, in the four adjacent
counties of Dorset, Somerset, Wiltshire, and Hants, we find surviving,
at the time of the Conquest, an archaic but uniform system of
provision for the needs of the Crown by the assignment of certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg 97]</span>
estates or groups of estates, the render of which was expressed in
terms of the 'firma noctis' or 'firma diei', and which, unlike the
country around them, had never been assessed in 'hides'.</p>

<p>Mr Seebohm hints slightly at this <i>firma</i> system,<a id="footnotetagid201" name="footnotetagid201"></a><a href="#footnoteid201"><sup>201</sup></a>
but only speaks
of it as existing in Dorset. Nor does he allude to the significant fact
of such Manors having never been hidated. It would lead us far
afield to speculate on the origin of this system, or to trace its possible
connection with the Welsh <i>gwestva</i>.<a id="footnotetagid202" name="footnotetagid202"></a><a href="#footnoteid202"><sup>202</sup></a>
Nor can we here concern
ourselves with the few scattered traces of it that we meet with elsewhere
in Domesday. Its existence in four adjacent counties, with
non-hidation as a common feature, is the point I wish to emphasize.</p>

<p>The system of grouping townships in the west for the payment of a
food-rent (<i>firma unius noctis</i>) was exactly parallel to the grouping in
the east for the payment, not of rent but of 'geld'. We can best trace
this parallel in Somerset, because the <i>firma unius noctis</i> of the days
before the Conquest had been there commuted for a money payment
at the time of Domesday. Turning to the Cambridgeshire
hundred of Long Stow, we find one of its 'blocks' (of twenty-five
hides) divided into three equal parts, while another is divided into
three parts, of which one is half the size of the two others. And so in
Somerset we have Frome and Bedminster combined in one group for
the payment of this <i>firma</i>, and the two Perrotts similarly combined
with Curry. Frome and Bedminster are each assigned the same payment,
but in the other group the contribution of one is half that of
the two others.</p>

<p>Here are the Somerset groups of demesne, each charged with the
render of a <i>firma unius noctis</i>.</p>

<p>Of these two last, Milborne Port is entered as having paid three-quarters
of a <i>firma noctis</i> under the Confessor, while Bedminster&mdash;though
in the midst of this group of <i>firma</i> Manors&mdash;is alone in having
no render T.R.E. assigned to it. One is tempted to look on the two as
originally combined in one <i>firma</i> (like Somerton and Chedder), save
that the whole width of the county divides them, while in the other
cases the constituents are grouped geographically.</p>

<p>From the figures given for Somerset and Wilts, it may fairly be
concluded that, in this district, the value of the 'firma' was about &pound;105.
In Somerset, however, there was clearly a special sum, &pound;106 0s 10d,
on which calculations were based.</p>

<p>An examination of Mr Eyton's statements on the <i>firma unius noctis</i>
in Somerset and Dorset would prove a peculiarly conclusive test of
his whole system.</p>

<p>In the case of Somerset one need not dwell on his giving its
amount for the Williton group as &pound;105 16s 6&frac12;d, when the sum
named is &pound;105 17s 4&frac12;d, although absolute accuracy is, in these
matters, essential. We will pass at once to the bottom of the page
(ii. 2), and collate his rendering of Domesday with the original:</p>

<table class="diff1" summary="comparison" border="0">

<tr>
     <td class="w2">
     'T.R.E. reddebat dimidiam
     firmam noctis et quadrantem'
     (Domesday).
	 </td>
     <td class="w2">
     'Reddebat T.R.E. dimidiam
     noctis firmam et unum quadrantem'
     (Eyton).
	 </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Domesday gives the payment (in a characteristic phrase), as <em>three-quarters</em>
[a half and a quarter] of a <i>firma noctis</i>. Mr Eyton first interpolates
a 'unum', and then overlooks the 'quadrantem', with the
result that he represents the due T.R.E. as a <i>firma dimidi&aelig; noctis</i>
(i. 77). So far, this is only a matter of error <i>per se</i>. But Domesday
records the commutation of the due T.R.W. at &pound;79 10s 7d. This
proves to be <em>three-quarters</em> of the commutation, in two other cases, for
a whole <i>firma noctis</i> (&pound;106 0s 10d). Mr Eyton, however, imagining
the due to have been only <i>half a firma</i> set himself to account for its
commutation at so high a figure (i. 77-8). This he found no difficulty
in doing. He explained that 'this was not a mere commutation', but
'was doubtless a change which took into consideration the extra
means and enhanced value of Meleborne'.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg 99]</span></p>

<blockquote><p>
The probability is, then, that what we have called the <i>enhanced ferm</i>, was
enhanced by something less than the gross profits we have instanced; that is,
that a part of those profits, say the Burgage rents, or some of them, had
contributed to the <i>dimidia firma noctis</i> before the commutation.
</p></blockquote>

<p>All these ready assumptions, we must remember, are introduced to
account for a discrepancy which does not exist.</p>

<p>Great masses of Mr Eyton's work consist of similar guesses and
assumptions. Now, if these were kept scrupulously apart from the
facts, they would not much matter; but they are so inextricably
confused with the real facts of Domesday that, virtually, one can
never be sure if one is dealing with facts or fancies.</p>

<p>And far more startling than the case of Somerset is that of Dorset,
the 'Key to Domesday'. Mr Eyton here held that Dorchester,
Bridport, and Wareham paid a full <i>firma unius noctis</i> each, the total
amount being reckoned by him at the astounding figure of &pound;312
(p. 70)! Exeter, which affords a good comparison, paid only &pound;18 (as
render), though the king had 285 houses there: the three Dorset
towns in which, says Mr Eyton, the Crown had 323 houses, paid in
all, according to him, &pound;312. The mere comparison of these figures is
sufficient. But further, Mr Eyton observes (p. 93), that in 1156
'Fordington, Dorchester, and Bridport' were granted by Henry II
to his uncle, 'as representing Royal Demesne to the annual value of
&pound;60'. This is an instructive commentary on his view that Dorchester
and Bridport alone rendered &pound;208 per annum. Our doubts being
thus aroused, we turn to Domesday and find that it does not speak of
any of these towns as paying that preposterous <i>firma</i>. The right
formula for that would be 'reddit firmam unius noctis' (p. 84).
Instead of that, we only have 'exceptis consuetudinibus qu&aelig;
pertinent ad firmam unius noctis' (p. 70). The explanation is quite
simple. Just as in Somerset, Mr Eyton admits, Langport and
Ilchester, although boroughs, were 'interned' in groups of Royal
demesne, paying the <i>firma unius noctis</i>, so in Dorset the boroughs
were 'interned' in groups of Royal demesne. Indeed one of these
groups was headed by Dorchester, and is styled by Mr Eyton the
'Dorchester group'. But he boldly assumed that 'Dorchester' must
have two different meanings:</p>

<blockquote><p>
[A] We assume about 100 acres to have belonged to the Domesday
Burgh, and perhaps 882 acres to represent land, subinfeuded at Domesday,
and annexed to Dorchester Hundred. [B] It follows that we assume about
429 acres, [to be that] ... which here figures [fo. 75] under the name
Dorchester.
</p></blockquote>

<p>It is not too much to say that any one, who refers to pp. 70-3,
78-101 of the <cite>Key to Domesday</cite>, will find that the singular misconception
as to the Dorset Boroughs makes havoc of the whole
calculation. But here again the point to be insisted on is not the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg 100]</span>
mere mistake <i>per se</i>, but the elaborate assumptions based upon it
and permeating the whole work.<a id="footnotetagid204" name="footnotetagid204"></a><a href="#footnoteid204"><sup>204</sup></a></p>

<p>Apart from the Manors grouped for a <i>firma unius noctis</i>, if we take
the comital Manors (<i>mansiones de comitatu</i>) of Somerset, which were
in the King's hands in 1086, we find their rentals given on quite a
different principle to those of the Manors in private hands.</p>

<p>(1) They are entered as renders ('reddit'), not as values ('valet').</p>

<p>(2) The sums rendered are 'de albo argento'.</p>

<p>(3) In at least ten out of the fifteen cases, they are multiples of
the strange unit &pound;1 3s.</p>

<p>As this fact seems to have escaped Mr Eyton's notice, I append a
list of these Manors, showing the multiples of this unit that their
renders represent:</p>

<p>Whatever this strange unit represented, it formed the basis in these
Manors of a reckoning wholly independent of the 'hides' or ploughlands
of the Manor, and as clearly artificial as the system of hidation
I have made it my business to explain.</p>

<h4>XV. 'WARA'<a name="page100a" id="page100a"></a></h4>

<p>The meaning of 'Wara' is made indisputable by the I.C.C. When
land was an appurtenance, <i>quoad</i> ownership, of a Manor in one
township, but was assessed in another in which it actually lay, the
land was said to be in the former, but its 'wara' in the latter. As
this 'wara' was an integral part of the total assessment of the
township, it had to be recorded, under its township, in the I.C.C.
Here are the three examples in point:</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<span class="sc">Histon.</span>] De his xx. hidis jacet Warra de una hida et dimidia in hestitone
de manerio cestreford. Hanc terram tenuit comes alanus [<i>sic</i>] et est appretiata
in essexia (p. 40).</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg 101]</span></p>

<p>[<span class="sc">Shelford.</span>] De his xx. hidis tenet petrus valonensis iii. hidas de firma
regis in neueport.... H&aelig;c terra est berewica in neueport, sed Wara jacet in
grantebrigge syra (p. 49).</p>

<p>[<span class="sc">Trumpington.</span>] De his vii. hidis [tenet] unus burgensis de grenteburga i.
virgam. Et Warra jacet in trompintona, et terra in grantebrigga (p. 51).
</p></blockquote>

<p>To these I may add a fourth instance, although in this case the name
<i>wara</i> does not occur:</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<span class="sc">Bathburgam.</span>] De his vii. hidis tenet Picotus in manu regis dimidiam
hidam et dimidiam virgam. H&aelig;c terra jacet in cestreforda et ibi est appretiata
xxx. sol. in essexia (p. 36).
</p></blockquote>

<p>The lands at Histon and 'Bathburgam' were mere outlying portions
of the royal Manor of Chesterford in Essex, and those at Shelford
were a 'berewick' of the royal Manor of Newport, also in Essex.
But they were all <em>assessed</em> in Cambridgeshire, where they actually
lay.</p>

<p>So also we read under Berkshire (61<i>b</i>): 'H&aelig;c terra jacet et appreciata
est in Gratentun quod est in Oxenefordscire, et tamen dat
scotum in Berchesire'. Again (203<i>b</i>) we read under Pertenhall:
'Hec terra sita est in Bedefordsire, set geldum et servitium reddit in
Hontedunscyre'. A good instance of the same arrangement in
another part of England is found in those Worcestershire Manors
which were annexed as estates to Hereford, but which were assessed
in those Worcestershire Hundreds where they actually lay (see p. <a href="#page60">60</a>).</p>

<p>A similar expression is applied to the possession of 'soca'. Thus
under Shelford we read:</p>

<blockquote><p>
De hac terra adhuc tenuerunt iii. sochemanni dimidiam hidam sub gurdo
comite. Non potuerunt recedere sine licentia comitis gurdi. Et soca jacebat
in Witlesforda (p. 48).
</p></blockquote>

<p>Here the land was in Shelford, but the jurisdiction (soca) was
attached to Earl Gyrth's Manor of Whittlesford.</p>

<p>Prof Vinogradoff has dealt with 'the word <i>wara</i>' in his <cite>Villainage
in England</cite> (i. 241-4), and asserts that the 'origin and use of the
term is of considerable importance'. But he does not allude to the
above evidence, and I cannot follow him in his argument. While
rightly disregarding Mr Pell's fanciful derivation from 'warectum',
he asserts that:</p>

<blockquote><p>
We often find the expression 'ad inwaram' in Domesday, and it corresponds
to the plain 'ad gildam [<i>sic</i>] regis'. If a Manor is said to contain
seven hides <i>ad inwaram</i>, it is meant that it pays to the king for seven hides....
The Burton cartulary, the earliest survey after Domesday, employed the
word 'wara' in the same sense.
</p></blockquote>

<p>One cannot disprove the first proposition without reading through
all Domesday for this purpose. I can only say that I do not remember
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg 102]</span>
ever meeting in Domesday Book with such an expression. The solitary
instance of its use known to me is in the <cite>Liber Niger</cite> of Peterborough
(p. 159), where we read: 'in Estona sunt iii. hid&aelig; ad in Waram';
and there the relevant entry in Domesday has no such expression.
Of the statement as to the Burton cartulary, one can positively
say it is an error. Its 'war&aelig;' have quite another meaning and are
spoken of as virgates would elsewhere be.</p>

<p>Collation with what I have termed the Northamptonshire geld-roll
renders it clear that 'wara', in Domesday, represents the old
English word for 'defence', in the sense of assessment, the 'defendit
se' formula of the great Survey leading even to the phrase of
'Defensio x. acrarum', for assessment to Danegeld, which is found
in the first volume of Fines published by the Pipe-Roll Society.</p>

<h4>XVI. THE DOMESDAY 'JURATORES'<a name="page102a" id="page102a"></a></h4>

<p>I now approach the subject of the Domesday <i>juratores</i>.</p>

<p>The lists of these in the I.E. and in the I.C.C. afford priceless
information. The latter gives us the names for all but three of the
Cambridgeshire Hundreds, the former for all Cambridgeshire (one
Hundred excepted) and for three Hertfordshire Hundreds as well.
The opening paragraph of the I.E. tells us 'quomodo barones regis
inquisierunt, videlicet per sacramentum vicecomitis scire et omnium
baronum et eorum francigenarum et tocius centuriatus presbyteri
prepositi vi. villani [<i>sic</i>] uniuscuiusque ville'.<a id="footnotetagid206" name="footnotetagid206"></a><a href="#footnoteid206"><sup>206</sup></a>
Careful reading of
this phrase will show that the 'barones regis' must have been the
Domesday Commissioners. The difficulty is caused by the statement
as to the oaths of the sheriff, the tenants-in-chief (<i>barones</i>),
and their foreign (? military) under-tenants (<i>francigen&aelig;</i>). The lists of
<i>juratores</i> contain the names of many <i>francigen&aelig;</i> in their respective
hundreds, but, so far as I can find, of no tenants-in-chief. The
sheriff, of course, stands apart. His name indeed in the I.C.C. is
appended to the list of jurors for the first Hundred on the list, but
is not found in the I.E. Moreover, it should be noted that the above
formula speaks of all the tenants-in-chief, but only of a single Hundred
court. Two hypotheses suggest themselves. The one, that the
sheriff and <i>barones</i> of the county made a circuit of the Hundreds,
and then handed in, on their oaths, to the commissioners a return
for the whole county; the other, that the circuit was made by the
commissioners themselves, attended by the sheriff and <i>barones</i>.
In the former case it is obvious that the commissioners would fail
to obtain at first hand that direct local information which it was their
object to elicit: and further, when we find the sheriff and <i>barones</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg 103]</span>
charged with wrongdoing in these very returns, it is, to say the least,
improbable that they were their own accusers, especially in the
case of such a sheriff as Picot, at once dreaded and unscrupulous.</p>

<p>It seems, therefore, the best conclusion that the Domesday
commissioners themselves attended every Hundred court, and
heard the evidence, sometimes conflicting, of 'French' and
'English'.<a id="footnotetagid207" name="footnotetagid207"></a><a href="#footnoteid207"><sup>207</sup></a></p>

<p>The <em>order</em> in which the Hundreds occur must not be passed over,
because their sequence distinctly suggests a regular circuit of the
country. Here is the sequence given in our three authorities: the
I.C.C., the I.E., and the list of jurors prefixed to the latter:</p>

<p>On comparing the first two of these lists it will be found that
(except in the case of three contiguous Hundreds, which does not
affect the argument) the Hundreds are taken in a certain sequence,
which is seen, on reference to the valuable map prefixed to Mr
Hamilton's book, to represent a circuit of the southern portion of
the county from north-east to north-west, followed by an inquest on
the district to its north, the 'two Hundreds' of Ely.</p>

<p>The third list, on the other hand, misplaces the Hundreds of
Triplow and Erningford altogether, and wholly omits that of
Childeford. The transposition and omission are both notable
evidence that the B and C texts, as I shall urge, were derived from
some common original which contained these defects.</p>

<p>The essential point, however, is that a circuit was made of the
county whether merely by the sheriff, or, as seems most probable,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg 104]</span>
by the Domesday Commissioners themselves&mdash;the 'barones regis'
of the record&mdash;who must have attended the several Hundred-courts
in succession.</p>

<p>But when we speak of the Hundred-court it is necessary to explain
at once that the body which gave evidence for the Domesday
Inquest was of a special and most interesting character. It combined
the old <i>centuriatus</i>&mdash;deputations of the priest, reeve, and six villeins
from each township (<i>villa</i>)&mdash;with the new settlers in the Hundred,
the <i>francigen&aelig;</i>. A careful investigation of the lists will prove that half
the <i>juratores</i> were selected from the former and half from the latter.
This fact, which would seem to have been hitherto overlooked,
throws a flood of light on the compilation of the Survey, and
admirably illustrates the King's policy of combining the old with the
new, and fusing his subjects, their rights and institutions, into one
harmonious whole. Conquerors and conquered were alike bound
by their common sworn verdicts.<a id="footnotetagid209" name="footnotetagid209"></a><a href="#footnoteid209"><sup>209</sup></a></p>

<p>We have the lists, in all, for eighteen Hundreds, fifteen in Cambridgeshire
and three in Herts, of which two were 'double'. There
were, practically, for each Hundred exactly eight <i>juratores</i>, half of
them 'French' and half 'English'. But the two 'double' Hundreds
had sixteen each, half of them 'French' and half 'English'. Although
it is recorded that 'alii omnes franci et angli de hoc hundredo
juraverunt', it is obvious that the eight men always specially
mentioned were, in a special degree, responsible for the verdict.
Their position is illustrated, I think, by the record of a Cambridgeshire
<cite>placitum</cite> found in the Rochester chronicles. This is the famous
suit of Bishop Gundulf against Picot the sheriff in the County
Court of Cambridgeshire,<a id="footnotetagid210" name="footnotetagid210"></a><a href="#footnoteid210"><sup>210</sup></a>
which affords a valuable instance of a
jury being elected to confirm by their oaths the (unsworn) verdict of
the whole court:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Cum illis (i.e. omnes illius comitatus homines) Baiocensis episcopus, qui
placito pr&aelig;erat, non bene crederet; pr&aelig;cepit ut, si verum esse quod dicebant
scirent, ex seipsis duodecim eligerent, qui quod omnes dixerant jure jurando
confirmarent.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Now we read of this jury:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Hi autem fuerunt Edwardus de Cipenham, Heruldus et Leofwine saca
de Exninge, Eadric de Giselham, Wlfwine de Landwade, Ordmer de
Berlincham, et alii sex de melioribus comitatus.
</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg 105]</span></p>

<p>Investigation shows that the names mentioned are local. The land
in dispute was a holding in Isleham in the Hundred of Staplehoe.
One juror, Eadric, came from Isleham itself, two from Exning, one
from Chippenham, one from Landwade, while the sixth, Ordmer,
was an under-tenant of Count Alan, in the Manor from which he
took his name (Badlingham), and was a Domesday juror for the
Hundred. These six, then, were clearly natives chosen for their
local knowledge. The other six, chosen 'de melioribus comitatus',
were probably, as at the Domesday inquest, Normans (<i>Franci</i>).
Thus the double character of the jury would be here too preserved,
and the principle of testimony from personal knowledge upheld.</p>

<p>So again in the Dorset suit of St. Stephen's, Caen (1122),<a id="footnotetagid211" name="footnotetagid211"></a><a href="#footnoteid211"><sup>211</sup></a>
the men of seven Hundreds are convened, but the suit is to be
decided 'in affirmatione virorum de quatuor partibus vicinitatis illius
vill&aelig;'.<a id="footnotetagid212" name="footnotetagid212"></a><a href="#footnoteid212"><sup>212</sup></a>
Accordingly, 'sexdecim homines, tres videlicet de Brideport,
et tres de Bridetona, et decem de vicinis, juraverunt se veram
affirmationem facturos de inquisitione terr&aelig; illius'. The names of the
jurors are carefully given: 'Nomina vero illorum qui juraverunt,
h&aelig;c sunt'. Again in the same Abbey's suit for lands in London,
'per commune consilium de Hustingo, secundum pr&aelig;ceptum regis,
elegerunt quatuordecim viros de civibus civitatis Londoni&aelig; qui
juraverunt'. And in this case also we read: 'H&aelig;c sunt nomina illorum
qui juraverunt.... Et h&aelig;c sunt nomina eorum in quorum pr&aelig;sentia
juraverunt.'<a id="footnotetagid213" name="footnotetagid213"></a><a href="#footnoteid213"><sup>213</sup></a></p>

<p>This corresponds, it will be seen, exactly with the writ to which the
<cite>Inquisitio Eliensis</cite> was, I hold, the return: 'Inquire ... qui eas
(terras) juraverunt et qui jurationem audierunt' (<i>infra</i>, p. <a href="#page114">114</a>).</p>

<p>Enough has now been said to show that the names of the Domesday
jurors recorded for each Hundred represent a jury of eight,
elected to swear on behalf of the whole Hundred, and composed of
four foreigners and four Englishmen, in accordance with the
principle that the conflicting interests ought to be equally represented.<a id="footnotetagid214" name="footnotetagid214"></a><a href="#footnoteid214"><sup>214</sup></a></p>

<p>We may take, as a typical set of <i>juratores</i>, those for the Hundred
of Erningford, the survey of which, in Mr Hamilton's book, occupies
pp. 51-68. I give them in their order:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg 106]</span></p>

<table summary="juratores for Erningford" border="0">
<tr>
<th>[<i>Francigen&aelig;</i>]</th>

       <td>Walterus Monachus</td>

       <td class="leftn5b">Alfuuinus odesune</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>All four <i>francigen&aelig;</i> can be identified in the Hundred. Walter held a
hide and a quarter in 'Hatelai' from the wife of Ralf Tailbois;
Humfrey, a hide and a quarter in 'Hatelai', from Eudo dapifer;<a id="footnotetagid215" name="footnotetagid215"></a><a href="#footnoteid215"><sup>215</sup></a>
Hugh, a hide and a half in 'Melrede', from Hardwin de Scalers;
and Richard, three virgates in 'Mordune', from Geoffrey de
Mandeville. Of the <i>Angli</i>, Colsuenus was clearly Count Alan's under-tenant
at three townships within the Hundred, holding in all two
hides; 'Ailmarus', his son, was, just possibly, the 'Almarus de
Bronna', who was a tenant of Count Alan in two adjacent townships,
holding two hides and three-eighths; 'Turolfus' and 'Alfuuinus'
cannot be identified, and were probably lower in the social
scale.</p>

<p>It will be observed that Colsweyn belongs to a special class,
the English under-tenants. He is thus distinct at once from the
<i>Francigen&aelig;</i>, and from the villeins of the township. He and his peers,
however, are classed with the latter as jurors, because they are both
of English nationality. In the great majority of cases the English
<i>juratores</i> cannot be identified as under-tenants, and may therefore
be presumed to have belonged to the township deputations.</p>

<h4>XVII. THE 'INQUISITIO ELIENSIS'<a name="page106a" id="page106a"></a></h4>

<p>The record known by this name has long been familiar to Domesday
students, but no one, so far as I know, has ever approached the
questions: Why was it compiled? When was it compiled? From
what sources was it compiled? These three questions I shall now
endeavour to answer.</p>

<p>First printed by the Record Commission in their 'Additamenta'
volume of Domesday (1816), its editor, Sir Henry Ellis, selected
for his text the most familiar, but, as I shall show, the worst of its
three transcripts (Cott. MS., Tib. A. VI), though he knew of what
I believe to be the best, the Trin. Coll. MS., O. 2, 1, which seems to
be the one styled by him 68 B 2.<a id="footnotetagid216" name="footnotetagid216"></a><a href="#footnoteid216"><sup>216</sup></a>
In his introduction he thus described it:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg 107]</span></p>

<blockquote><p>
The <cite>Inquisitio Eliensis</cite> is a document of the same kind with the Exeter
Domesday; relating to the property of the Monastery of Ely recorded
afterwards in the two volumes of the Domesday Survey (p. xiv).
</p></blockquote>

<p>From this it would seem that Ellis believed the <cite>Inquisitio</cite>, at any rate,
to be previous to Domesday Book, but he practically left its origin
altogether in doubt.</p>

<p>Sixty years later (1876) the <cite>Inquisitio</cite> was published anew, but
without any further solution of the points in question being offered.<a id="footnotetagid217" name="footnotetagid217"></a><a href="#footnoteid217"><sup>217</sup></a>
For this edition three MSS. were collated, with praiseworthy and
infinite pains, by Mr N. E. S. A. Hamilton. Taking for his text, like
Ellis, the Cottonian MS. Tib. A. VI, which he distinguished as A,
he gave in footnotes the variants found in the MSS. at Trinity
College, Cambridge, viz.: O. 2, 41 (which he termed B), and O. 2,
1 (which he distinguished as C). In Mr Hamilton's opinion (p.
xiv) the 'C' text 'appears to have been derived from the "B"
MS. rather than the Cottonian' ('A'). From this opinion, it will be
seen, I differ wholly.</p>

<p>A careful analysis of the three texts has satisfied me beyond
question that while C is the most accurate in detail, it is marred by a
peculiar tendency to omission on the part of its scribe. This, indeed,
is its distinctive feature. Now B cannot be derived from C, because it
supplies the latter's omissions. On the other hand, C cannot be
derived from B, because it corrects, throughout, B's inaccuracies.
Consequently they are independent. More difficult to determine is
the genesis of A, the worst of the three texts; but as it virtually
reproduces all the inaccuracies found in B (besides containing
many fresh ones), without correcting any, it can only be inferred
that B was its source. Thus we have on the one hand C, and, on the
other B (with its offspring A), derived independently from some
common source. And this conclusion agrees well with the fact that a
long catalogue of lands abstracted from the House of Ely is found in
C, but not in A or B,<a id="footnotetagid218" name="footnotetagid218"></a><a href="#footnoteid218"><sup>218</sup></a>
and with the circumstance that the famous
rubric ('Hic subscribitur inquisitio'), which heads the inquisition in
A and B, is placed by C at the end of the lists of jurors.<a id="footnotetagid219" name="footnotetagid219"></a><a href="#footnoteid219"><sup>219</sup></a></p>

<p>Starting from this conclusion, let us now proceed to ask, what was
the document from which B and C copied independently? Clearly,
it was not Domesday Book, for outside the eastern counties they
record the returns in full, like the <cite>Inq. Com. Cant.</cite> itself. Were they
then taken from the original returns, or at least from the copy of
those returns in the <cite>Inq. Com. Cant.</cite>? This point can only be determined
by close analysis of the variants; if we find B and C containing
occasionally the same errors and peculiarities, although copied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg 108]</span>
independently, it follows that the document from which they
both copied must have contained those same errors and peculiarities.
Let us take the case of Papworth. The right reading, as given both in
Domesday and the <cite>Inq. Com. Cant.</cite>, I have placed on the left, and
the wrong reading, in B and C, on the right:</p>

<table class="diff2a" summary="errors" border="0">

       <td class="w2"><p>[tenet abbas] ii. hidas et iii.

<p>Again, the clause 'Tost<a id="footnotetagid222" name="footnotetagid222"></a><a href="#footnoteid222"><sup>222</sup></a>
pro viii. hidis et xl. acris', which ought
to head the Hardwick entries, is wrongly appended in the I.E.
(p. 110) to a Kingston entry with which it had nothing to do. So
too, 'hoc manerium pro x. hidis se defendit [<i>sic</i>] T.R.E. et modo pro
viii. hidis', which belongs to Whaddon, is erroneously thrown back
by the I.E. (p. 107), into Trumpington, a Manor in another
Hundred. It is singular also that all the MSS. of the I.E. read
'iii. cotarii' (p. 101), where D.B. and the I.C.C. have 'iii. bordarii'
(p. 3), and 'x. cotarii' (p. 101), where they have 'x. bordarii' (p. 6):
conversely, the former, in one place, read 'xv. bordarii' (p. 107),
where the latter have 'xv. cotarii' (p. 63).</p>

<p>In comparing the text of the I.E. with that of the I.C.C., we shall
find most striking and instructive variants in the lists of <i>juratores</i>
for the several Hundreds. Take, for instance, the lists for the
Hundreds of Cheveley and Staines, which follow one another in both
MSS.</p>

<p>The second name on these lists can be conclusively tested. For the

'Euerard[us]', while the I.E. is right in adding 'homo Alb[er]ici

<p>It is impossible to examine the italicized variations in these parallel
texts without coming to the conclusion that they must have been
independently derived from some common original, an original
containing more detail than either of them. On the other hand, the
comparatively close agreement between the texts of the actual
returns in the I.C.C. and the I.E. leads one to infer that these were
copied with far more exactitude than the comparatively unimportant
surnames of the jurors. For us the value of these variations in the
jurors' lists lies in the evidence afforded to the origin of the existing
MSS.</p>

<p>The object of this careful scrutiny has been to prove that as certain
errors and peculiarities are found in two independent MSS., they
must have existed in the original document from which both were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg 111]</span>
copied, and which was neither the I.C.C. transcripts nor the
original Domesday returns. What then was this document? It was,
and can only have been, the true <cite>Inquisitio Eliensis</cite>, the date and
origin of which I shall discuss below. Further, I should imagine this
document to have probably been a roll or rolls, which&mdash;on its contents
being subsequently transcribed into a book for convenience&mdash;was
allowed, precisely as happened to the Domesday rolls themselves,
to disappear. In perfect accordance with this view we find the
whole contents of the <cite>Inquisitio</cite> arranged for a special purpose, and
no mere transcript of the Domesday returns. Thus, after abstracting
all the entries relating to the Cambridgeshire estates, and subjoining
a list of houses held in Cambridge itself, it proceeds to add
up all the items independently, and record their total values to the
Abbey. This analysis is carried out for several counties (pp. 121-4),
and is, of course, peculiar to the <cite>Inquisitio</cite>, although inserted between
the abstracts of the Domesday returns for Cambridgeshire and
Herts. So too the breviate or short abstract of the estates (pp. 168-173),
which was part of the original document&mdash;for it is found in all
the derived MSS.&mdash;must have been specially compiled for it, and so
also was the <i>Nomina Villarum</i> (pp. 174-83).</p>

<p>Another peculiarity of the <cite>Inquisitio</cite> is the care with which it
records the names of sokemen on the Abbey estates when omitted
in the I.C.C. and D.B. This may lead us to ask whether its compilers
supplied these names from their personal knowledge. We
might think not, for in some cases they are recorded by the D.B.
and the I.C.C., while in one (p. 106) the I.E. actually omits the
name, reading only 'quidam sochemanus', where the other two
documents (p. 46) supply his name ('Fridebertus'). From this we
might infer that the names were probably recorded in the original
returns, but deemed of too slight importance to be always copied by
the transcriber. Yet the balance of evidence leads me to believe
that the I.E. did supply names from independent knowledge.
With the values, however, the case is clearer. The I.E. contains
special and exclusive information on the value of socman-holdings,
and must, I think, have derived it from some other source than the
original Domesday returns. Here are some instances in point.</p>

<p>This last passage, of itself, is full of instruction. Firstly, the I.E.
alone gives the value of the holding. Secondly, the I.E. preserves
the 'sine socha' which qualifies the holder's right. Now D.B. gives
the last clause as:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Hi omnes terras suas vendere potuerunt. Soca tantum hominis abbatis de
Ely remansit &aelig;cclesi&aelig;.
</p></blockquote>

<p>This qualification corresponds with the 'sine socha' of the I.E.,
and is, we should observe, wholly omitted in the I.C.C. Thirdly,
the three versions of the original return employ three different words
to express the same one&mdash;'recedere', 'vendere', 'dare'. Fourthly, the
superiority of the C text of the I.E. over B (which makes two
blunders in this passage) and of B over its offspring A (which adds a
third) is here well illustrated. Fifthly, the phrase 'Picot vicecomes
tenet eam sub abbate ely' differs notably from Domesday, which
assigns the estate to Picot unreservedly, and still more from the
I.C.C. which reads 'tenet Robertus de Picoto vicecomite in feudo
regis'.</p>

<p>The next example is taken from the township immediately
preceding.</p>

<p>I have said that in all these cases it might perhaps be held that the
additional details found in the I.E. were not due to special information
possessed by its compilers, but were derived from the
original returns, though omitted by their other transcribers. It is
possible, however, to put the matter to the test. If, anticipating for a
moment, we find that we have, for the eastern counties, in Domesday
the actual materials from which the compilers of the I.E.
worked, we can assert that any additional details must have been
supplied from their own knowledge. An excellent instance in
point is afforded by Tuddenham, in Suffolk:</p>

<p>One knows not, truly, which blunder is the worst, that of the

i.e. Ely Abbey, into 'Sax&aelig;', or that of the compiler of the I.E., who, by
interpolating the word 'viginti', has converted three shillings into
three-and-twenty. But the point is that the latter could name the
Abbot's sokeman (nameless in Domesday) and could supply his

<p>Domesday records the totals only.</p>

<p>Enough has now been said of the twelfth century transcripts in
which alone are preserved to us the contents of the <cite>Inquisitio</cite>. We
have seen that they point to the existence of some common original,
which, while closely parallel with Domesday, as a record of the
Abbey's possessions, contained certain special features and additional
information. Why, when, and from what sources that original was
compiled, I shall now endeavour to explain.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg 114]</span></p>

<h4>XVIII. THE ELY RETURN</h4>

<p>The theory I propound for the origin of the so-called <cite>Inquisitio
Eliensis</cite> is that it was the actual return ordered by that writ of the
Conqueror,<a id="footnotetagid238" name="footnotetagid238"></a><a href="#footnoteid238"><sup>238</sup></a>
of which a copy is given in all three MSS. (A, B, C)
and which is printed in Mr Hamilton's book, on p. xxi (No. VIII).
I give the wording of the writ, followed by the heading to the
<cite>Inquisitio</cite> with which it should be closely compared.</p>

<blockquote><p>
Willelmus Rex Anglorum Lanfranco archiepiscopo salutem.... Inquire
per episcopum Constantiensem et per episcopum Walchelinum et per ceteros
qui terras sanct&aelig; &AElig;deldrede scribi et jurari fecerunt, quomodo jurate

et quante, et quot, et quomodo vocate [et] qui eas tenent. His distincte
notatis et scriptis fac ut cite inde rei veritatem per tuum breve sciam. Et
cum eo veniat legatus abbatis.</p>

<h5><span class="sc">Return</span></h5>

&AElig;duardi, et quando Rex Willelmus dedit et qualiter modo sit, et si potest
plus haberi quam habeatur.</p>

<p>Isti homines juraverunt, etc., etc.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Especially important is the fact that the return contains the jurors'
names, in accordance with the express injunction to that effect in
the Conqueror's writ.</p>

<p>Now if this theory meet with acceptance, and the writ be taken
to refer, as I suggest, to the Domesday Inquest itself, it follows that
the Bishop of Coutances and Bishop Walchelin were the heads of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg 115]</span>
the Domesday Commission for this district. This, of course, has
been hitherto unknown; but it adds to the presumption in favour of
the facts that Bishop Walchelin is not mentioned in any of the
Ely writs as taking part in the <cite>placita</cite> concerning the Abbey's lands,
and that, therefore, the only Inquest in which he could have been
concerned was the Domesday Inquest itself. It should be added,
however, that these two Bishops may have been, respectively, the
heads of two distinct commissions for adjoining groups of counties.</p>

<p>The heading to the <cite>Inquisitio Eliensis</cite> is so well known, and has
been so often quoted by historians, that it is a gain to fix its <i>status</i>,
the more so as it has been loosely described as the 'official' instructions
for the Survey itself. We may also determine the date of
the writ as the very close of the Conqueror's reign. For it must have
been issued between William's departure from England, <i>circ.</i>
September 1086, and his death (September 1087).</p>

<p>And now, how was the return compiled? It deals, we find, with
six counties, arranged in this order: Cambridgeshire, Herts, Essex,
Norfolk, Suffolk, and Hunts. For <i>Cambridgeshire</i> it copies, clearly,
from the original returns. For Herts it must have done so also,
because it gives full details, which are not found in Domesday
Book. This conclusion is confirmed by the fact that, for these two
counties, it gives the jurors' names (for the hundreds dealt with),
which it could only have obtained from those original returns. For
<i>Essex</i>, <i>Norfolk</i>, and <i>Suffolk</i>, on the contrary, it simply
gives the same
version as the second volume of Domesday Book, and omits accordingly
the jurors' names. The case of the four Manors in <i>Hunts</i> I leave
in doubt, because the version in the <cite>Inquisitio</cite> (pp. 166-7) has more
details than that of Domesday, though the latter is here exceptionally
full, and because it places first the Manor which comes fourth in
Domesday (i. 204). The additional details (as to live-stock) are
such as we might expect to be derived from the additional returns;
but the names of the witnesses for the Hundred are not recorded, a
fact to be taken in conjunction with the belated entry of these
Huntingdonshire Manors not following, as they should, those in
Cambridgeshire and Herts.</p>

<p>In addition to the <cite>Inquisitio</cite> itself, as printed by the Record
Commission,
there is a record, or collection of records, which follows it in
all three MSS., and which is printed in Mr Hamilton's book (pp.
168-89). Although its character is not there described, it can be
determined. For in the <cite>Inquisitio</cite> there are three references to the
'breve abbatis de ely' (pp. 123-4), all three of which can be identified
in the above record (pp. 175-7). It is noteworthy that the record in
question is only complete in C, which confirms my view that B and
its offspring A were independent of C.</p>

<p>Though the word <i>Breve</i> in Domesday Book normally means the
king's writ, there are passages which seem to have been overlooked,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg 116]</span>
and in which it bears another and very suggestive meaning. One of
them is found at the end of the Survey of Worcestershire and was
foolishly supposed by the compilers of the index volume (pp. 250,
315) to relate to lands held by 'Eddeva' and entered immediately
before it. The passage is an independent note, running thus:</p>

<blockquote><p>
In <span class="sc">Esch</span> Hund' jacent x. hid&aelig; in Fecheham et iii. hid&aelig; in Holewei et
script&aelig; sunt in <i>brevi de Hereford</i>.</p>

<p>In <span class="sc">Dodintret</span> Hund' jacent xiii. hid&aelig; de Mertelai et v. hid&aelig; de Suchelei
qu&aelig; hic placitant et geldant, et ad Hereford reddunt firmam suam, et
sunt script&aelig; in <i>breve</i> <i>regis</i> (i. 178).
</p></blockquote>

<p>All four places are found on fo. 180<i>b</i>, 'Feccheham' and 'Haloede'
[<i>sic</i>]<a id="footnotetagid243" name="footnotetagid243"></a><a href="#footnoteid243"><sup>243</sup></a>
together (under 'Naisse' Hundred<a id="footnotetagid244" name="footnotetagid244"></a><a href="#footnoteid244"><sup>244</sup></a>)
as paying a joint ferm&mdash;'Merlie'
(Martley) under 'Dodintret' Hundred and Suchelie
(Suckley), now in Herefordshire, as 'in Wirecestrescire' (cf. i. 172).</p>

<p>It is clear then that Domesday here uses 'breve' of a return, not of
a writ, and I venture to think the word may refer to the abbreviated
entries made in Domesday Book itself as distinct from those <i>in extenso</i>
found in the original returns.<a id="footnotetagid245" name="footnotetagid245"></a><a href="#footnoteid245"><sup>245</sup></a></p>

<p>This usage is found in both volumes. We read of land at Marham,
Norfolk, held by Hugh de Montfort; 'est mensurata in brevi Sanct&aelig;
Adeldret' (ii. 238), where the reference is to the 'Terra Sanct&aelig;
Adeldredr&aelig;' (ii. 212), and of Hurstington Hundred, Hunts, 'Villani
et sochemanni geldant secundum hidas in brevi scriptas' (i. 203).
The reference, in both cases, is to the text itself.</p>

<p>The former of these two phrases is repeated in the <cite>Inquisitio
Eliensis</cite>,<a id="footnotetagid246" name="footnotetagid246"></a><a href="#footnoteid246"><sup>246</sup></a>
a fact of some importance if, as I venture to think, it is
there meaningless. The point is worth labouring. We see that the
phrase cannot have occurred in the original returns, where all the
entries relating to Marham would have come together. But if it was
only applicable to Domesday Book itself&mdash;where the fiefs were
separated&mdash;then must the I.E. have copied from Domesday Book.</p>

<p>This, indeed, is the point to which I am working. For Essex,
Norfolk, and Suffolk, I believe, the compilers of the <cite>Inquisitio</cite> (1086-7)
must have worked from the second volume of Domesday as we have
it now. We see it <em>firstly</em>, in the order of the counties; <em>secondly</em>,
in the
absence of the jurors' names; <em>thirdly</em>, in the system of entering the
lands. With a fourth and minute test I have dealt just above.</p>

<p>But to make this clearer, we must briefly analyse the return. The
Cambridgeshire portion extends from p. 101 to p. 120. It extracts
from the original returns, Hundred by Hundred, all that relates to the
Abbey of Ely. Following this is a note of its possessions in the Borough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg 117]</span>
of Cambridge<a id="footnotetagid247" name="footnotetagid247"></a><a href="#footnoteid247"><sup>247</sup></a>
(pp. 120-1), and then summaries of the Abbey's
estates, in <i>dominium</i> and <i>thainland</i> and <i>socha</i>, in all six
counties, and of
the lands held by Picot the Sheriff, Hardwin d'Eschalers and Guy
de Raimbercurt, to which it laid claim as its own (pp. 121-4). Then
we resume with Hertfordshire, the extracts from the original returns
(pp. 124, 125). Both the Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire portions
close with the words, 'De toto quod habemus', etc., referring to the
totals worked out by the Abbey from the entries in the original
returns.</p>

<p>With Essex, we enter at once on a different system. This portion,
which extends from p. 125 to p. 130 (line 8), is arranged not by
Hundreds but by fiefs. It first gives the lands actually held by the
Abbey (as coming first in Domesday), and then those of which
laymen were in possession. To the latter section are prefixed the
words: 'Has terras calumpniatur abbas de ely secundum breve regis'.
From Essex we pass to Norfolk, the entries for which, commencing
on p. 130 with the words 'In Teodforda', end on p. 141 at 'Rogerus
filius Rainardi'. These again are divided into two portions, namely,
the lands credited to the Abbey in Domesday (pp. 130-6), and
those which it claimed but which Domesday enters under other
owners (pp. 137-41). Between the two comes the total value of the
former portion and a list of the Norfolk churches held by the Abbey.
Last of the Eastern counties is Suffolk, which begins on p. 141 at
'In Tedeuuartstreu hund.', and ends on p. 166. This also is in two
portions, but the order seems to be reversed, the alleged aggressions
on the Abbey's lands coming first and its uncontested possessions
last. The latter portion begins on p. 153, where the B text inserts
the word 'Sudfulc'.</p>

<p>The one variation, the Bishop's style, has a curious parallel in
Domesday Book (i. 165), where under the rubric 'Terra Episcopi
Constantiensis' we read 'Episcopus de Sancto Laudo tenet', etc.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg 118]</span></p>

<p>We may take it then that the compilers of the <cite>Inquisitio Eliensis</cite>
worked for Cambridge and Herts from the original returns, but, for
the eastern counties, from the second volume of Domesday. What
are the corollaries of this conclusion? They used, for some reason or
other, the second volume of Domesday, but not the first&mdash;if, indeed,
it then existed. Speaking for myself, I have always felt not a little
uneasy as to the accepted date for the completion of Domesday
Book.<a id="footnotetagid248" name="footnotetagid248"></a><a href="#footnoteid248"><sup>248</sup></a>
Mr Eyton went so far as to write:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Imperial orders have gone forth that the coming Codex, the Domesday
that is to outlive centuries, is to be completed before Easter (April 5th, in
that year [1086]), when King William himself expects to receive it in his
Court and Palace of Winchester (<cite>Notes on Domesday</cite>, 15).
</p></blockquote>

<p>And he explicitly stated that:</p>

<blockquote><p>
On any hypothesis as to the time taken by the different processes which
resulted in Domesday Book, the whole, that is the survey, the transcription,
and the codification, were completed in less than eight months, and three of
the eight were winter months. No such miracle of clerkly and executive
capacity has been worked in England since.<a id="footnotetagid249" name="footnotetagid249"></a><a href="#footnoteid249"><sup>249</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>But was it worked then? All that the chronicle says of the King is
that the '<i>gewrita</i> w&aelig;ran gebroht to him', a phrase which does not
imply more than the original returns themselves.</p>

<p>Of course, the chief authority quoted is the colophon to the second
volume:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Anno millesimo octogesimo sexto ab incarnatione Domini vicesimo vero
regni Willelmi facta est ipsa descriptio non solum per hos tres comitatus sed
etiam per alios.
</p></blockquote>

<p>It seems to have been somewhat hastily concluded that because the
Survey ('Descriptio Angli&aelig;') took place in 1086, Domesday Book
(which styles itself <cite>Liber de Wintonia</cite>), was completed in that year.
The phrase 'per hos tres comitatus' proves, surely, that 'descriptio'
refers to the Survey, not to the book.<a id="footnotetagid250" name="footnotetagid250"></a><a href="#footnoteid250"><sup>250</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg 119]</span></p>

<p>I have never seen any attempt at a real explanation of the great
difference both in scope and in excellence between the two volumes,
or indeed any reason given why the Eastern counties should have
had a volume to themselves. For a full appreciation of the contrast
presented by the two volumes, the originals ought to be examined.
Such differences as that the leaves of one are half as large again as
those of other, and that the former is drawn up in double, but the
latter in single column, dwarf the comparatively minor contrasts of
material and of handwriting. So, too, the fullness of the details in the
second volume may obscure the fact of its workmanship being greatly
inferior to that of the first. Of its blunders I need only give one
startling instance. The opening words of the Suffolk Survey,
written in bold lettering, are 'Terra Regis de Regione' (281<i>b</i>). I
have no hesitation in saying that the last words should be 'de <i>Regno</i>'.
Indeed, the second formula is found on 289<i>b</i>, as 'Terra Regis
de Regno', while on 119<i>b</i> under 'Terra Regis', we read 'hoc
manerium fuit de regno'. So also in the Exon Domesday
'Terra Regis' figures as 'Dominicatus regis ad regnum pertinens'.<a id="footnotetagid251" name="footnotetagid251"></a><a href="#footnoteid251"><sup>251</sup></a>
The muddled order of the tenants-in-chief for Norfolk and for
Suffolk&mdash;where laymen precede the church<a id="footnotetagid252" name="footnotetagid252"></a><a href="#footnoteid252"><sup>252</sup></a>
&mdash;is another proof of
inferiority, but only minute investigation could show the hurry or
ignorance of the scribes.</p>

<p>Now, all this might, I think, be explained if we took the so-called
second volume to be really a first attempt at the codification of the
returns. Its unsatisfactory character must have demonstrated the
need for a better system, which, indeed, its unwieldy proportions
must have rendered imperative. So drastic and so successful, on this
hypothesis, was the reform, that while these three counties had
needed a volume of 450 folios, the rest of England that was surveyed&mdash;some
thirty counties&mdash;was compressed into a single volume of 382
folios, and on a system which rendered consultation easier and more
rapid. In every respect the first volume is a wonderful improvement
on the second, but the authorities may have shrunk from ordering
the latter to have been compiled <i>de novo</i>, when the work, though
unsatisfactory, had once been done.</p>

<p>This, it must of course be remembered, is all hypothesis, a hypothesis
suggested by the facts. If it were proved that at the time when
the Ely return was made, the 'second' volume had been compiled,
and the 'first' had not, I should have established my case. But it
might be urged that the 'first' volume did exist at the time, and that
the Ely scribes used the returns instead, because they contained
fuller information. To this I reply, so far as the details of the estates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg 120]</span>
are concerned, that neither the terms of the writ nor the heading of
the <cite>Inquisitio</cite> involved the inclusion of such details as Domesday
Book omitted. If the scribes inserted them, it must have been merely
because they inserted everything they found in the records from
which they copied. It might still be urged that they went to the
returns for the names of the <i>juratores</i>; but why, if so, did they not do
so for the three eastern counties? It certainly seems to me to be the
most satisfactory explanation that the materials supplied for compiling
this return, as being the recognized official records, were the
so-called 'second' volume of Domesday, and (for the rest) the
original returns.</p>

<h4>XIX. FIRST MENTION OF DOMESDAY BOOK<a name="page120a" id="page120a"></a></h4>

<p>No one nowadays should require to be told that the pseudo-Ingulf's
dealings with Domesday are devoid of all authority. Some,
however, may still believe in the tale found in that 'Continuatio' of
his chronicle which is fathered on Peter of Blois. It is there that Ellis
found (putting Ingulf aside) the only case of an appeal to its witness
before the reign of John.<a id="footnotetagid253" name="footnotetagid253"></a><a href="#footnoteid253"><sup>253</sup></a></p>

<p>With the 'Continuatio' I shall deal below,<a id="footnotetagid254" name="footnotetagid254"></a><a href="#footnoteid254"><sup>254</sup></a>
but I would observe,
while on the subject, that the 'pseudo-Ingulf' (charters and all) was,
I believe, largely concocted by the help of hints gathered from
Domesday Book.</p>

<p>The absence of any authoritative mention, in its early days, of our
great record gives a special importance to an entry in the <cite>Chronicle
of Abingdon</cite> (ii. 115-6), where we read that Abbot Faritius was
impleaded by certain men:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Sed is abbas in castello Wincestre coram episcopis Rogero Saresberiensi,
et Roberto Lincolniensi, et Ricardo Londoniensi, et multis regis baronibus,
ratiocinando ostendit declamationem eorum injustam esse. Quare, justiciarorum
regis judicio obtinuit ut illud manerium, etc. ... sed quia rex tunc
in Normanni&acirc; erat, regina, qu&aelig; tunc pr&aelig;sens erat, taliter hoc sigillo suo
confirmavit.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Then follows the Queen's writ, announcing the decision of the plea
held in the royal 'Curia', together with the names of the 'barons'
present. These names enable us to determine a certain limit for the
date of the plea. 'Thurstinus Capellamus', for instance, implies that
it was previous to his obtaining the See of York in 1114, while the
presence of Richard, Bishop of London, places it subsequent to
July 26, 1108. It must, therefore, have been held during the King's
absence between July 1108 and the end of May 1109; or in his
later absence from August 1111 to the summer of 1113.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg 121]</span></p>

<p>The action of the Queen in presiding over this <cite>placitum</cite> illustrates a
recognized practice, of which we have an instance in Domesday
itself (i. 238<i>b</i>), where it is stated that Bishop Wulfstan, 'terram
deplacitasse coram regina Mathilde in presentia iiii<sup>or.</sup> vicecomitatuum'.
The Queen's description of the <cite>Curia Regis</cite> as 'curia domini
mei et mea' should be compared with the phrase employed by the
Queen of Henry II, who, similarly acting in her husband's absence,
speaks of the Great Justiciar as 'Justicia Regis et mea'.</p>

<p>But the essential portion of the passage before us is this:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Sciatis quod Faritius abbas de Abendona in curia domini mei et mea,
apud Wintoniam in thesauro ... <i>per Librum de Thesauro</i>, diratiocinavit quod,
etc.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The court was held 'in castello Wincestre', says the narrative, 'apud
Wintoniam in thesauro', says the record. Both are right, for the
Royal Treasury was in Winchester Castle.<a id="footnotetagid255" name="footnotetagid255"></a><a href="#footnoteid255"><sup>255</sup></a></p>

<p>But what was the 'Liber de Thesauro'? I contend that it was
Domesday Book, and can have been nothing else. For, passing now
to the <cite>Dialogus de Scaccario</cite> (<i>circa</i> 1177), we there read in reply
to an
inquiry as to the nature of Domesday Book (which 'in thesauro
servatur et inde non recedit'): '<i>liber ille</i> de quo qu&aelig;ris sigilli regii
comes est individuus <i>in thesauro</i>' (I. XV.). The connection of the
Book with the Treasury is brought out strongly in the <cite>Dialogus</cite>,
and leads to the presumption, as Mr Hall perceived, that the
Treasury being originally at Winchester, the Book was there
also&mdash;as indeed we see it was under Henry I.<a id="footnotetagid256" name="footnotetagid256"></a><a href="#footnoteid256"><sup>256</sup></a>
On the date of its removal to Westminster, there has been much discussion between
my friend Mr Hall and myself.<a id="footnotetagid257" name="footnotetagid257"></a><a href="#footnoteid257"><sup>257</sup></a>
Mr Hall relies mainly on the <cite>Dialogus de Scaccario</cite>, and on the inferences he draws from it, for the
early removal of Domesday to Westminster, and the establishment
there of the royal Treasury. For myself, I claim for the Winchester
Treasury greater importance and continuity than he is willing to
admit. The leading records, of course, were stored there as well as
treasure. We find William Rufus speaking of 'meis brevibus ... qui
sunt in thesauro mea Wyntoni&aelig;';<a id="footnotetagid258" name="footnotetagid258"></a><a href="#footnoteid258"><sup>258</sup></a>
and we read that, on his father's death, 'pergens apud Wincestre thesaurum patris sui ... divisit:
erant autem in thesauro illo lx. m[ille] libr&aelig; argenti excepto auro et
gemmis et vasis et palliis.'<a id="footnotetagid259" name="footnotetagid259"></a><a href="#footnoteid259"><sup>259</sup></a>
Heming's Cartulary describes the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg 122]</span>
Domesday returns as stored 'in thesauro regali', and Henry of
Huntingdon states that 'inter thesauros reposita usque hodie servantur'.<a id="footnotetagid260" name="footnotetagid260"></a><a href="#footnoteid260"><sup>260</sup></a>
Now, as the Treasury was in Winchester Castle at the
time of the above suit, and as it had been in 1100<a id="footnotetagid261" name="footnotetagid261"></a><a href="#footnoteid261"><sup>261</sup></a>
and 1087, so it was still at the accession of Stephen in 1135, and at the triumph of
Matilda in 1141. This is absolutely certain from the Chronicles, nor
do they ever mention any other Treasury. Moreover, the contents of
this Treasury in 1135&mdash;'erant et vasa tam aurea quam argentea'&mdash;correspond
with those described by the <cite>Dialogus</cite> forty years later:
'vasa diversi generis aurea et argentea'. Lastly, there is a piece of
evidence which has not yet been adduced, namely, that in his
<cite>Expugnatio Hibernica</cite> (1188), Giraldus, speaking of that ring and
letters which John of Salisbury declared had been brought by him
from the Pope, and were 'still stored in the Royal Treasury', writes of</p>

<blockquote><p>
Annulum aureum in investitur&aelig; signum ... qui statim simul cum privilegio
<cite>in archivis Wintoniae</cite> repositus fuerat.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Giraldus certainly must have looked on the Royal Treasury at
Winchester as the only recognized repository for all such objects as
these.</p>

<p>Mr Hall, indeed, has gradually modified his original position that
'Ingulphus saw the Domesday register, as it now exists, at Westminster',
and that it was sent there for good from Winchester 'early
in the reign of Henry I',<a id="footnotetagid262" name="footnotetagid262"></a><a href="#footnoteid262"><sup>262</sup></a>
but he still places the establishment of
'the' Treasury at Westminster, in my opinion, too early. It is the
gradual decay of Winchester as the capital and seat of administration
that makes it difficult to say positively when or how the national
records, Domesday Books among them, were transferred to Westminster.
We have seen at least that, in its early days, the 'Liber de
Wintonia', as it styles itself, had its home within the walls of the
Royal castle of Winchester; and I cannot but think, now as at first,
that it began by visiting Westminster for Exchequer sessions only.<a id="footnotetagid263" name="footnotetagid263"></a><a href="#footnoteid263"><sup>263</sup></a></p>

<p>In any case, we have seen its witness appealed to on a far earlier
occasion than had hitherto been known. In my paper on 'An Early
Reference to Domesday',<a id="footnotetagid264" name="footnotetagid264"></a><a href="#footnoteid264"><sup>264</sup></a>
I quoted an even earlier mention of the
'Descriptio Angli&aelig;', but here again the reference seems to make
rather to the Domesday Survey itself than to Domesday Book, the
'Liber de Thesauro'.</p>

<p>As an appendix to this paper, I give the pedigree of the Domesday
MSS. according to the views I have expressed.<a id="footnotetagid265" name="footnotetagid265"></a><a href="#footnoteid265"><sup>265</sup></a></p>

In this instance the omission is so gross that it attracted Mr Hamilton's notice.
He admits in a footnoteid that his MS. 'confounds two separate entries'. It would,
however, be more correct to say that the MS. here omits a portion of each. It is
easy to see how the scribe erroneously 'ran on' from the first portion of one entry
to the second portion of another. This entry has a further value, for while D.B.
convicts the I.C.C. of omitting the words 'de Widone', it is itself convicted, by
collation, of omitting the entry, 'Terra est i. bovi'.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="footnoteid14" name="footnoteid14"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotetagid14"><sup>14</sup></a>
The I.C.C. here wholly omits one of the three holdings T.R.E. 'The three

a virgate held by Wulfwine, her man. It is this last holding which is omitted.
Note here that the Domesday 'hide' is composed as ever (<i>pace</i> Mr Pell) of four
virgates.</p>

feature, notes the employment of a similar device in Domesday Book itself in the
case of Yorkshire. 'Against such errors and redundancies a very simple but effective
precaution seems to have been adopted by some clerk or clerks employed on the
Yorkshire notes. Before transcription was commenced an index was made of the
loose notes of that county. This index gave the contents of each Wapentac or
Liberty in abstract under the appropriate title; then the measure in carucates and
bovates of each item of estate; and lastly (interlined) some hint or indication to
whose Honour or fief each item belonged. This most clerkly device will have
saved the subsequent transcribers much trouble of roll-searching and a world of
confusion in their actual work.'</p>

(i.e. in 'Campes') tenet Normannus de Alberico dimidiam hidam.' The Domesday

We have three separate statements (of which more anon) of the aggressions
of these three men on the Abbey's lands. Taking the one printed on pp. 175-7
of Mr Hamilton's book, we find that of the twelve estates grasped by Hardwin,
all but one or two can be identified as the subject of duplicate entries in Domesday.
(A disputed hide and a half in 'Melrede', though not mentioned in this list, is also
entered in duplicate.) But neither of the estates seized by Guy de Raimbercurt is
so entered in Domesday. The first two of those which Picot is accused of abstracting
are entered in duplicate, but not the following ones. There is one instance of a
duplicate entry of another character, relating to half a virgate (D.B., i, 199, <i>b</i>, 2,
gives it erroneously as half a hide, but D.B., i, 190, <i>a</i>, 1, rightly as half a virgate),
which Picot, as sheriff had regained for the king against the 'invading' Aubrey.</p>

This is not always the case. At Whaddon, for instance, the entry under

It is to this evidence that I made allusion in <cite>Domesday Studies</cite> (p. 225). Similar

<p class="footnote"><a id="footnoteid76" name="footnoteid76"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotetagid76"><sup>76</sup></a>
D.B. erroneously reads 'xxx.' (30) by the insertion of an 'x' too many. The
I.C.C. correctly reads 'xx.' (20), its accuracy here being proved by the above
arithmetic. Thus the I.C.C. corrects a reading which (1) would, but for it, appear
fatal to the belief that 30 acres = a virgate; (2) would upset the above arithmetic.
This ought to be clearly grasped, because it well illustrates the element of clerical
error, and shows how apparent discrepancies in our rule may be due to a faulty
text alone.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="footnoteid77" name="footnoteid77"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotetagid77"><sup>77</sup></a>
Here, as in the preceding instance, Domesday is in error, reading 'one

The <em>blunder</em> consists in treating 6&frac12; (geld) acres as part of the Countess Judith's

I do not here discuss the cause of the reduction. Indeed, this would be hard
to discover; for the original assessment was distinctly low, whether we compare it
with the aggregate of ploughlands or of valuation. It is true that the total of

On this point one may compare with profit 'the making of the Danelaw'
(858-78), by the late Mr Green (<cite>Conquest of England</cite>, pp. 114-29), who had devoted
to this subject much attention. He discusses the limits of Eastern Mercia, the
district of the Five Boroughs, in the light of local nomenclature (<cite>Ibid.</cite>, pp. 121-2),
and includes within it, on this ground, Northamptonshire, while observing that the
country about Buckingham, which formed the southern border of the 'Five
Boroughs', has no 'byes'. My own evidence is wholly distinct from that of local
nomenclature, and defines more sharply the district settled and reorganized by the
Danes. The hidation of Northamptonshire is peculiar, a unit of four (reminding one
of the Mercian shilling) coming into prominence. Still, it was not carucated, but
retained its assessment in hides.</p>

'T.R.E. geldabat pro ii. hidis, sed tamen <i>sunt</i> ibi xii. hid&aelig;', have sometimes been
understood to imply two geldable, but twelve arable hides, whereas both figures
refer to assessment only.</p>

Mr de Gray Birch asserts on his authority that 'this valuable manuscript' is not
responsible for that date (<cite>Domesday Book</cite>, p. 71). All these writers are mistaken.
The <cite>Diologus de Scaccario</cite>, indeed, does not mention a year, but Swereford's famous
Introduction, in the Red Book of the Exchequer, does give us, by an astounding
blunder, the fourteenth year of the Conqueror (1079-80) as the date of Domesday

<h3>THE NORTHAMPTONSHIRE GELD-ROLL</h3>

<p>This remarkable document was printed by Sir Henry Ellis (1833)
in his <cite>General Introduction to Domesday</cite> (i. 184-7) from the fine Peterborough
Cartulary belonging to the Society of Antiquaries (MS. 60).
I shall not, therefore, reprint it here, but will give the opening
entry as a specimen of its style:</p>

<blockquote><p>
This is unto Suttunes (Sutton) hundred, that is an hundred hides. So it
was in King Edward's day. And thereof is 'gewered' one and twenty hides
and two-thirds of a hide, and [there are] forty hides inland and ten hides
[of] the King's ferm land, and eight and twenty hides and the third of a
hide waste.
</p></blockquote>

<p>We have seen (<i>supra</i>, p. 59) that Ellis not only erred, but even led
Dr Stubbs into error, as to the character of the 'hundreds' enumerated
in this document. Except for that, I cannot find any real notice
taken of it, although it has been in print over sixty years. It appears to
be not even mentioned in Mr Stuart Moore's volume on <cite>Northamptonshire
in Domesday</cite>; and no one, it seems, has cared to inquire
to what date it belongs, or what it really is.<a id="footnotetagng1" name="footnotetagng1"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteng1"><sup>1</sup></a></p><!-- ng -->

<p>Now, although written in old English, it is well subsequent to the
Conquest, for it mentions <i>inter alias</i> 'Rodbertes wif heorles', who, we
shall find, was Maud, wife of the Count of Mortain. It also mentions
William and Richard Engaine, Northamptonshire tenants in Domesday.
On the other hand, it cannot be later than 1075, for it speaks of
lands held by 'the lady, the King's wife'; and this was Edith, Edward's
widow, whose Northamptonshire lands passed to King William at
her death in 1075. Of the very few names mentioned, one may
surprise and the other puzzle us. The former is that of 'the Scot
King', holding land even then in a shire where his successors
were to hold it so largely: the other is 'Osmund, the King's writer',
in whom one is grievously tempted to detect the future Chancellor,
Saint and Bishop. But, apart from his identity, his peculiar style,
exactly equating, as it does, the Latin 'clericus regis', emboldens
me to make the hazardous suggestion that we possibly have in this
document an English rendering of a Latin original, executed in the
Peterborough <cite>scriptorium</cite>.</p>

<p>For what was the purpose of the document? It may be pronounced
without hesitation to be no other than a geld-roll, recording, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg 125]</span>
would seem, a levy of Danegeld hitherto unknown.<a id="footnotetagng2" name="footnotetagng2"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteng2"><sup>2</sup></a> There are three
features which it has in common with the rolls of 1084: it is drawn
up hundred by hundred; it records the exemption of demesne; and it
specifies those lands that had failed to pay their quota.<a id="footnotetagng3" name="footnotetagng3"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteng3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Its salient feature is one that, at first sight, might seem to impugn
its authenticity. This is the almost incredible amount of land lying
'waste'. If we confine our attention to the land liable to geld represented
by the first and fourth columns in my analysis below, we see
that by far the larger proportion of it is entered as 'waste': yet this
witness to a terrible devastation is the best proof of its authenticity;
for it sets before us the fruits of those ravages in the autumn of
1065, which are thus described by Mr Freeman, paraphrasing the
English chronicle:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Morkere's Northern followers dealt with the country about Northampton
as if it had been the country of an enemy. They slew men, burned corn and
houses, carried off cattle, and at last led captive several hundred prisoners,
seemingly as slaves. The blow was so severe that it was remembered even
when one would have thought that that and all other lesser wrongs would
have been forgotten in the general overthrow of England. Northamptonshire
and the shires near to it were for many winters the worse.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr Freeman, had he read it, would have eagerly welcomed our
record's striking testimony to the truth of the Chronicle's words.</p>

<p>The devastation that our roll records had been well repaired at
the time of Domesday; but we obtain a glimpse of it in the Rockingham
entry: 'Wasta erat quando rex W. jussit ibi castellum fieri.
Modo valet xxvi. sol.' (i. 220).</p>

<p>But it is not only that the entries of 'waste' on our roll are thus
explained: they further prove it to be, as I have urged, a 'Danegeld'
roll. For, when we compare it with the Pipe-Roll of 2 Henry II
(1156), we find the latter similarly allowing for the non-receipt of
geld from land 'in waste'; and it is specially noteworthy that the
portion thus 'waste' is in every case, as on our roll, entered after the
others. The fact that the geld was remitted on land that had been
made 'waste' is now established by collation of these two records.</p>

<p>Incidentally, it may be pointed out that as our document bears
witness to the devastation of Northamptonshire in 1065, so the first
surviving roll of Henry II illustrates the local range of devastation
under Stephen. In Kent, which had been throughout under the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg 126]</span>
royal rule, the waste was infinitesimal; in Yorkshire it was slight;
but in the Midlands, which had long been the battle-ground of rival
feudal magnates, it was so extensive that, as here in Northamptonshire
after the Conquest, there was more land exempted as 'waste'
than there was capable of paying.</p>

<p>Before leaving this subject I briefly compare the cases of Northamptonshire
and of East Sussex. In the former, we have seen, it is
only our document that preserves for us evidence of the ravages in
1065; Domesday does not record them, because they had then (1086)
been repaired. But in East Sussex, the entries are fuller; and as was
observed by Mr Hayley, an intelligent local antiquary:</p>

<blockquote><p>
It is the method of Domesday Book, after reciting the particulars relating
to each Manor, to set down the valuation thereof, at three several periods,
to wit, the time of King Edward the Confessor, afterwards <em>when the new
tenant entered upon it</em>, and again at the time when the survey was made. Now
it is to be observed in perusing the account of the Rape of Hastings in that
book, that in several of the Manors therein <em>at the second of these periods</em>, it is
recorded of them that they were waste, and from this circumstance it may
upon good ground be concluded what parts of that Rape were marched over
by, and suffered from the ravages of the two armies of the Conqueror and
King Harold; and indeed, the situations of those Manors is such as evidently
shows their <em>then</em> devastated state to be owing to that cause.<a id="footnotetagng4" name="footnotetagng4"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteng4"><sup>4</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr Freeman's treatment of this theory was highly characteristic.
In the Appendix he devoted to the subject<a id="footnotetagng5" name="footnotetagng5"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteng5"><sup>5</sup></a> he first contemptuously
observed of the allusion to Harold's army:</p>

<blockquote><p>
This notion would hardly have needed any answer except from the sort
of sanction given to it by the two writers who quote Mr Hayley. I do not
believe that any army of any age ever passed through a district without
doing some damage, but to suppose that Harold systematically harried his
own kingdom does seem to me the height of absurdity.
</p></blockquote>

<p>And he, further, indignantly denied that such a King as Harold
was 'likely to mark his course by systematic harrying'. Now, Mr
Hayley had never charged him with 'systematic harrying'; he had
merely traced with much ingenuity, the approach of his army to
Senlac by the damage, Mr Freeman admits, its passage, when
assembled, must have caused.</p>

<p>The fact is that Mr Hayley had, and Mr Freeman had not,
read his Domesday 'with common care'.<a id="footnotetagng6" name="footnotetagng6"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteng6"><sup>6</sup></a> The latter started from the
hasty assertion that:</p>

<blockquote><p>
the lasting nature of the destruction wrought at this time is shown by the
large number of places round about Hastings which <em>are returned in Domesday</em>
as 'waste'.
</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg 127]</span></p>

<p>Hence he argued, Harold, even had he been 'Swegen himself'&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
could not have done the sort of lasting damage which is implied in the lands
being returned as 'waste' <em>twenty years after</em>. The ravaging must have been
something thorough and systematic, like the ravaging of Northumberland
a few years later.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The whole argument rests on a careless reading of Domesday.
It was on passages such as these that Mr Hayley had relied:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Totum manerium T.R.E. valebat xx. lib. Et <i>post vasta fuit</i>. Modo xviii. lib.
et x. sol.</p>

<p>Totum manerium T.R.E. valebat xiiii. lib. <i>Postea vastatum fuit.</i> Modo xxii.
lib.</p>

<p>Totum manerium T.R.E. valebat cxiiii. sol. Modo vii. lib. <i>Vastatum fuit.</i><a id="footnotetagng7" name="footnotetagng7"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteng7"><sup>7</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus, so far from being returned in 1086 as 'waste', these Manors,
we see, had already recovered from their devastation at the Conquest,
and had even, in some cases, increased their value. And so Mr Freeman's
argument falls to the ground.</p>

<p>But as he was eager to vindicate Harold from a quite imaginary
charge, I will try to clear William from Mr Freeman's very real
one. Having wrongly concluded that the ravages were 'lasting',
and must therefore have been 'systematic', Mr Freeman wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>
There can be little doubt but that William's ravages were not only done
systematically, but were done with a fixed and politic purpose (p. 413) ...
there can be little doubt that they were systematic ravages done with the
settled object of bringing Harold to a battle (p. 741).
</p></blockquote>

<p>Possibly the writer had in his mind the harrying of the lands of the
Athenians, as described in the pages of Thucydides: but how can it
have been politic for William, not only to provoke Harold, but to
outrage the English people? It was Harold with whom his quarrel
lay; and as to those he hoped to make his future subjects, to ravage
their lands wilfully and wantonly was scarcely the way to commend
himself to their favour: it would rather impel them, in dread of his
ways, to resist his dominion to the death.</p>

<p>But if William's policy be matter of question, Domesday at least
is matter of fact; and Mr Freeman's followers cannot be surprised
at the opposition he provoked, when we find him thus ridiculing a
student for a charge he never made, and proved to have himself
erred from his careless reading of Domesday.</p>

<p>I now append an analysis of the roll, showing the proportion of
land 'gewered',<a id="footnotetagng8" name="footnotetagng8"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteng8"><sup>8</sup></a>
of 'inland', of <i>terra regis</i>, of land which had not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg 128]</span>
paid (in square brackets), and of 'waste'. The totals in square
brackets are those given in the document; the others are those
actually accounted for.</p>

<p>The persons mentioned as not having paid can in most cases be
identified. Thus 'Robert the Earl's wife' is one of those in Rothwell
Hundred, whose land was 'unwered'. This was clearly Maud, wife
of Count Robert of Mortain, who had been given lands by her
father, Roger of Montgomery, at Harrington in this Hundred.
Domesday, it is true, where it figures as 'Arintone', knows it only as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg 129]</span>
'Terra &aelig;cclesi&aelig; de Grestain' (222 <i>b</i>); but a charter of Richard I
(<i>per Inspeximus</i>) confirms to the Abbey 'ex dono Matildis Comitisse
Moreton ... xxxii. hidas terre quas dederat ei pater suus Rogerus de
Montegomerico, scilicet apud Haxintonam [<i>sic</i>] viii. hidas, etc.'<a id="footnotetagng14" name="footnotetagng14"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteng14"><sup>14</sup></a>
As the lands had first been given to Roger, then by him to his
daughter, and, finally, by her to the Abbey, I cannot think our
document earlier, at any rate, than 1068. Edith, whose name
proves it not to be later than 1075, is entered as 'the lady, the
King's wife', holding eight hides in Neuesland Hundred, and
again as a holder in Rothwell Hundred, under the name of 'the
King's wife'. Both entries, doubtless, refer to her wide-spreading
Manor of 'Tingdene' (<span class="sc">i</span>. 222), parts of which lay in both the above
Hundreds. Of the other holders we may notice 'Urs' (? Urse
d'Abetot), and 'Witeget the priest'; but these are quite eclipsed by
Richard and William Engaine, of whom the former occurs twice
and the latter thrice on the roll. In Spelho Hundred 'Richard'
seems to be credited with ten hides at 'Habintune' on which
'nan peni' had been paid. In Domesday his holding at Abintone is
given as <em>four</em> hides (i. 229). In the same Hundred, William's land at
'Multune' is in default. Moulton is not entered under his fief in
Domesday, but under that of Robert de Buci we find a 'William'
holding of him a hide and a virgate and a half in Moulton. This was
William Engaine, as was the 'William' of our roll; and in the Hen.
I-Hen. II survey,<a id="footnotetagng15" name="footnotetagng15"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteng15"><sup>15</sup></a>
we find land in Moulton entered as of Engaine's
fee. Still more interesting is it to note that so late as 25 Ed. I. more
than two centuries after Domesday, John Engayne is found holding
half a fee in Moulton of Ralf Basset, and Basset of the King <i>in
capite</i>. For, as our Leicestershire survey shows,<a id="footnotetagng16" name="footnotetagng16"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteng16"><sup>16</sup></a>
the Domesday fief of Robert de Buci had passed to Basset, of whose heir, therefore,
Engayne held, as his ancestor had held of Robert de Buci, in the
days of William the Conqueror.</p>

<p>It is particularly instructive to follow out the Northamptonshire
fief of William Engaine. In Domesday (i. 229) he is entered only as
'Willelmus' holding 3&frac12; hides in Pytchley (<i>Piteslea</i>), and Laxton
(<i>Lastone</i>), worth at that time, &pound;3 10s. 'Vitalis' Engaine was his heir
in 1130, for the Pipe-Roll of 31 Hen. I (p. 82) records his discharge
of a debt to the crown 'ut rehabeat terram suam de Laxetona'. And
this is confirmed by the survey of 1125 in the <cite>Liber Niger</cite> of
Peterborough, where we read under 'Pihtesle' (p. 162): 'Et Vitalis
reddit iii. solidos pro i. virga', this being the 'i. virga' assigned to
him in the list of Peterborough knights (<cite>Ibid.</cite>, p. 169). The 'Rotulus de
Dominabus' (1185) shows us the 'Piteslea' estate in the hands of
Margaret Engaine, makes it worth &pound;6, and mentions that her heir
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg 130]</span>
was Richard Engaine (p. 14). The 'Testa de Nevill' (p. 37)
enters Richard 'de Angayne' as holding five carucates of land in
'Pettesle' and 'Laxeton' worth &pound;6 a year. It tells us, further, that he
held them by serjeanty&mdash;'et est venator leporum, et facit servitium'.
From the nature of this return I assign it to the inquest of 1198, in
which case it is of some value, as identifying five carucates under the
new assessment with the 3&frac12; hides recorded in Domesday.<a id="footnotetagng17" name="footnotetagng17"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteng17"><sup>17</sup></a> Fulc de
Lisures, on the other hand&mdash;the heir of the Richard Engaine of
Domesday&mdash;returned himself in 1166, as the King's forester in fee and
attending the King's person, with his horn hanging from his
neck.<a id="footnotetagng18" name="footnotetagng18"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteng18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p>The association of Pytchley with hunting is carried back even
further still. For Richard and William Engaine had for their predecessor
in title, &AElig;lfwine the huntsman ('venator'), who owned their
lands when King Edward sat upon the throne.</p>

<p>Among the lands deducted we observe in Spelho Hundred 'fif
and xx. hida byrigland'. This represents the assessment in hides of
the Borough of Northampton, and, so far as I know, is the only
mention of that assessment to be found. In my paper on 'Danegeld
and the Finance of Domesday', I pointed out that Bridport and
Malmesbury were assessed at five hides each, Dorchester, Wareham,
and Hertford at ten hides, Worcester at fifteen, Bath and Shaftesbury
at twenty, etc.<a id="footnotetagng19" name="footnotetagng19"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteng19"><sup>19</sup></a> Northampton (we now see) was assessed in the
same manner, and Chester and Huntingdon at no less than fifty
hides each. Thus they admirably illustrate assessment in terms of the
five-hide unit. We find this primitive system obsolete in 1130, when
a borough gave an 'auxilium' where its county paid Danegeld.
But our roll implies that, here at least, it was already obsolete in
the early days of the Conquest; for the twenty-five hides of 'byrigland'
are, for the payment of 'geld', deducted from the Hundred.</p>

<p>From the date I have assigned to this document (<i>ante</i>-1075), it
may fairly claim to represent our earliest financial record. Its
illustrative value for Danegeld and the Hundred, and consequently
for Domesday Book, will be obvious to every student.</p>

I have found, since this was written, that it was printed by Mr T. O. Cockayne

Danegeld was levied by the Conqueror till the winter of 1083-4 and discussed
(<cite>Ibid.</cite>, 88-92) the <cite>Inquisitio Geldi</cite>, which, as Mr Eyton showed (<cite>Key to Domesday</cite>),
belongs to that date. It has been persistently confused with the Exon Domesday
(being bound up with it), as by Mr Jones, in his Wiltshire Domesday (pp. xxxvii.,

<h3>THE KNIGHTS OF PETERBOROUGH</h3>

<p class="title1c">(<i>Temp.</i> <span class="sc">Henry</span> I)</p>

<p>The interesting 'Descriptio militum de Abbatia de Burgo' is found
in the same MS. as the Northamptonshire Geld-roll.<a id="footnotetagkp1" name="footnotetagkp1"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotekp1"><sup>1</sup></a> <!-- kp -->
It was printed by Stapleton in the appendix to his <i>Chronicon Petroburgense</i> (pp.
168-75),<a id="footnotetagkp2" name="footnotetagkp2"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotekp2"><sup>2</sup></a> but no attempt was made to date it. The name of Eudo
Dapifer proves that it cannot have been compiled later than 1120.
On the other hand, it cannot well be earlier than 1100, for some of the
Domesday tenants had been succeeded by their sons&mdash;Robert (?)
Marmion, for instance, by Roger, and Coleswegen by Picot&mdash;while
the mention of 'Gislebertus filius Ricardi', possibly the son of
Richard of 'Wodeford' (i. 224<i>b</i>), points in the same direction. As
the majority of names, however, seem to be those of Domesday
tenants, it is probable that the list is not later than the Lindsey
survey itself, if, indeed, it is not earlier. The first entry it contains is a
good specimen of its value:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Asketillus de Sancto Medardo tenet de abbatia de Burch in Hamtonascira
x. hidas et iii. partes i. virg&aelig;, et in Lincolnescira iii. carrucatas et inde servit
se vi. milite. Et de feudo hujus militis dedit rex Willelmus senior Eudoni
Dapifero in Estona hidam et dimidiam et mandavit de Normannia in
Angliam Episcopo Constantiarum et R. de Oilli per breves suos ut inde
darent ei excambium ad valens in quocumque vellet de iii. vicinis comitatibus;
sed abbas noluit.
</p></blockquote>

<p>We duly find 'Anschitillus' in Domesday, holding 'Witheringham',
Northants and 'Osgodeby', Linc., of the Abbot (i. 221<i>b</i>, 345<i>b</i>).
In the same way we are enabled to identify the 'Rogerius Infans'
of our list with 'Rogerius' who held 'Pilchetone', according to
Domesday (i. 221<i>b</i>), of the Abbot, 'Ascelinus de Waltervilla' with
the 'Azelinus' of Domesday (<cite>Ibid.</cite>), 'Gosfridus nepos Abbatis', with
'Goisfridus' who held in 'Sudtorp' (<cite>Ibid.</cite>), and 'Rogerius Malfed'
with that 'Rogerius' who held of the Abbot at Woodford (i. 222).
'Rogerus', on the other hand, who held in Domesday two hides at
Milton, Northants (i. 221<i>b</i>), and seven bovates at Cleatham,
Linc. (i. 346), is represented in our list by the entry:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Turoldus de Meletona ii. hidas in Hamtonascira, et in Lindeseia vi.
bovatas, et inde servit se altero milite (p. 171).
</p></blockquote>

<p>The chief lesson taught us here is the rashness of assuming the
identity of tenants happening to bear the same name. For even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg 132]</span>
among the few who are named as holding of the Abbot of Peterborough,
we have found three Rogers quite distinct from one
another.</p>

<p>The entries which follow are of value as absolute proofs of
succession:</p>

</td>

</table>

<p>This second entry not only records a peculiarly interesting enfeoffment,
but identifies 'Colsuan', the Abbot's under-tenant at
Riseholme, with no less a person than the conqueror's 'English
favourite Coleswegen, ... an Englishman who, by whatever means,
contrived to hold up his head among the conquerors of England'.<a id="footnotetagkp3" name="footnotetagkp3"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotekp3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>As sons, in such cases as these, have succeeded their fathers, it
need not surprise us that our list comprises some names that are
found in the <cite>Liber Niger</cite> survey of 1125.<a id="footnotetagkp4" name="footnotetagkp4"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotekp4"><sup>4</sup></a> Vivian, whom, it tells us,
Abbot Turold had enfeoffed at Oundle (p. 175) occurs there in
that survey (p. 158), as does Robert d'Oilli at Cottingham (pp.
159-73).<a id="footnotetagkp5" name="footnotetagkp5"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotekp5"><sup>5</sup></a> Vitalis ('Viel') Engaine had succeeded William (Engaine)
at Pytchley both in our list and in the survey of 1125 (cf. <i>ante</i>,
p. 129).</p>

<p>One of the most interesting and important points in this list of
knights is the gleam of new light it throws on Hereward 'the Wake'.
In it we read:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Hugo de Euremou iii. hidas in dominio et vii. bovatas in Lincolneshira,
et servit pro ii. militibus.</p>

<p>Ansford iii. carucatas et servit pro dimidia hida [<i>sic</i>].
</p></blockquote>

<p>Now Hugh de Euremou is the name of the man who, according to
the pseudo-Ingulf, married Hereward's daughter. Here we have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg 133]</span>
proof of his real existence, and are enabled moreover to detect him,
I claim, in that Hugh who, as a 'miles' of the Abbot, held three
hides at 'Edintone' [Etton, Northants] in Domesday (i. 222).
Mr Freeman speaking of the vacancy at Bayeux in 1908, wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>
William at once bestowed the staff on Turold, the brother of Hugh of
Evermont [<i>sic</i>], seemingly the same Hugh who figures in the legend of
Hereward as his son-in-law and successor.<a id="footnotetagkp6" name="footnotetagkp6"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotekp6"><sup>6</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>But the French editors of Ordericus, in a note to the passage from
which this statement was taken (iv. 18), speak of our man as
'Hugue d'Envermeu, donateur du prieur&eacute; de St. Laurent d'Envermeu
&agrave; l'Abbaye de Bec'.<a id="footnotetagkp7" name="footnotetagkp7"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotekp7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>Turning for a moment from Hugh to Ansford, we read in the
Lincolnshire 'Clamores':</p>

<blockquote><p>
Terram Asford in Bercham hund' dicit Wapentac non habuisse Herewardum
die quo aufugiit (D.B., i. 376<i>b</i>).
</p></blockquote>

<p>About this entry, as Mr Freeman observed, 'there can be no doubt'.
But as the result of his careful inquiry,<a id="footnotetagkp8" name="footnotetagkp8"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotekp8"><sup>8</sup></a> he limited 'our positive
knowledge', from Domesday, to this entry and to two in the text of
the Lincolnshire survey (364<i>b</i>-377). It is strange that he did not
follow up the clue the 'Clamores' gave him. The relevant entry in
the text of the Survey is duly found under the Peterborough fief:</p>

<blockquote><p>
In Witham et Mannetorp et Toftlund habuit <i>Hereward</i> xii. bovatas terr&aelig;
ad geldum.... Ibi Asuert [<i>sic</i>] homo abbatis Turoldi habet, etc....</p>

<p>Berew[ita] hujus M. in Bercaham et Estou i. carucata terr&aelig; ad geldum.
... Ibi Asford habet, etc....</p>

<p>In Estov Soca in Witham iiii. bovat&aelig; terr&aelig; et dimidia ad geldum.... Ibi
Asfort de abbate habet, etc.... (i. 346).
</p></blockquote>

<p>This is the 'terra Asford' referred to in the 'Clamores', and, as
amounting to 3<small><sup>1</sup></small>&frasl;<small>16</small> carucates, it is clearly the 'iii. carucatas' assigned
in our list to 'Ansford'. Thus, through his successor Ansford, we
have at last run down our man; Hereward was, exactly as is stated
by Hugh 'Candidus', a 'man' of the Abbot of Peterborough; and
his holding was situated at Witham on the Hill,<a id="footnotetagkp9" name="footnotetagkp9"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotekp9"><sup>9</sup></a> not far from
Bourne, and, at Barholme-with-Stow a few miles off, all in the
extreme south-west of the county. This is the fact for which Mr
Freeman sought in vain, and which has eluded Professor Tout, in
his careful life of the outlaw for the <cite>Dictionary of National Biography</cite>.</p>

<p>We are now in a position to examine the gloss of Hugh 'Candidus',
showing how 'Baldwin Wake' possessed the holdings both of Hugh
and of Ansford:<a id="footnotetagkp10" name="footnotetagkp10"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotekp10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg 134]</span></p>

<blockquote><p>
Primus Hugo de Euremu. Baldwinus Wake tenet in Depinge, Plumtre, et
Stove feoda duorum militum.... Et pr&aelig;terea dictus Baldewinus tenet
feodum unius militis in Wytham et Bergham de terra Affordi. Et pr&aelig;dictus
Baldewinus de predictis feodis abbati de Burgo debet plenarie respondere
de omni forensi [servitio].
</p></blockquote>

<p>Here we see how the legendary name and legendary position of
Hereward were evolved. The Wakes, Lords of Bourne, held among
their lands some, not far from Bourne, which had once been held by
Hereward. Thus arose the story that Hereward had been Lord of
Bourne; and it was but a step further to connect him directly with
the Wakes, by giving him a daughter and heir married to Hugh de
Evermou, whose lands had similarly passed to the Lords of Bourne.
The pedigree-maker's crowning stroke was to make Hereward himself
a Wake,<a id="footnotetagkp11" name="footnotetagkp11"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotekp11"><sup>11</sup></a> just as Baldwin fitz Gilbert (de Clare) is in one place
transformed into a Wake.<a id="footnotetagkp12" name="footnotetagkp12"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotekp12"><sup>12</sup></a> The climax was reached when the
modern Wakes revived the name of Hereward, just as 'Sir Brian
Newcome of Newcome' set the seal to his family legend by giving
his children 'names out of the Saxon calendar'.</p>

<p>Returning to Hereward himself, we find Mr Freeman writing
(of the spring of 1070):</p>

<blockquote><p>
At this moment we hear for the first time of one whose mythical fame
outshines all the names of his generation, and of whom the few historical
notices make us wish that details could be filled in from some other source
than legend.... Both the voice of legend and the witness of the great Survey
agree in connecting Hereward with Lincolnshire, but they differ as to the
particular spot in the shire in which he is to be quartered. Legend also has
forgotten a fact which the document has preserved, namely, that the hero of
the fenland did not belong wholly to Lincolnshire, but that he was also a
landholder in the distant shire of Warwick. But the Survey has preserved
another fact with which the legendary versions of his life have been specially
busy. Hereward, at some time it would seem, before the period of his exploits,
had fled from his country.<a id="footnotetagkp13" name="footnotetagkp13"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotekp13"><sup>13</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Let us first dismiss from our minds the alleged fact as to Warwickshire.
There is absolutely nothing to connect the Count of Meulan's
tenant there with the Lincolnshire hero; indeed Mr Freeman
admits in his appendix 'that the Hereward of these entries may be
some other person' (p. 805). Legend had an excellent reason for
ignoring this alleged 'fact' as had 'romances' for having 'perversely
forgotten' to mention the deeds or the fate of William Malet in the
Isle (<cite>Ibid.</cite>, p. 473). We must also dismiss the 'fact'&mdash;'undoubted
history' though it be (<cite>Ibid.</cite>, p. 805)&mdash;of Hereward's 'banishment' at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg 135]</span>
some time between 1062 and 1070. For the Survey gives no date; it
merely speaks of 'die qu&acirc; aufugiit' (i. 376<i>b</i>), which phrase, in the
absence of evidence to the contrary, must be referred to his escape
from the 'Isle',<a id="footnotetagkp14" name="footnotetagkp14"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotekp14"><sup>14</sup></a> when (1071) in the words of Florence, 'cum paucis
evasit'. This at once explains the Domesday entry (<i>ante</i>, p. 160),
for he would, of course, have forfeited his holding before that date.</p>

<p>'But leaving fables and guesses aside,' in Mr Freeman's words,
'we know enough of Hereward to make us earnestly long to know
more' (p. 456). My proof that the English hero was a 'man' of the
Abbot of Peterborough explains why 'Hereward and his gang', as
they are termed in the Peterborough Chronicle, 'seem', Mr Freeman
is forced to admit, 'to be specially the rebellious tenants of the
Abbey', as distinct from the Danes and the outlaws (p. 459). And
the vindication, on this point, of Hugh Candidus' accuracy makes
one regret that Mr Freeman, though eager for information as to
Hereward, ignored so completely that writer's narrative. It is in
absolute agreement with the Peterborough Chronicle, Mr Freeman's
own authority, but records some interesting details which the
Chronicle omits.<a id="footnotetagkp15" name="footnotetagkp15"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotekp15"><sup>15</sup></a> These place Hereward's conduct in a somewhat
different light, and suggest that he may really have been loyal
to the Abbey whose 'man' he was. His plea for bringing the Danes
to Peterborough was that he honestly believed that they would
overthrow the Normans, and that the treasures of the church would,
therefore, be safer in their hands. He may perfectly well have been
hostile to the Normans, and yet faithful to the Abbey so long as
Brand held it; but the news that Turold and his knights were
coming to make the Abbey a centre of Norman rule against him<a id="footnotetagkp16" name="footnotetagkp16"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotekp16"><sup>16</sup></a>
would drive him to extreme courses. Professor Tout has made some
use of Hugh, but says, strangely, that 'the stern rule of the new
Abbot Turold drove into revolt the tenants', when his rule had not
yet begun.</p>

<p>Again, there is now no doubt where Hereward ought 'to be
quartered'. Two other places with which the Domesday survey
connects him are Rippingale and, possibly, Laughton to the north
of Bourne. Living thus on the edge of the fenland, he may well have
been a leader among 'that English folk of the fenlands' who rose,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg 136]</span>
says the Peterborough Chronicle, in the spring of 1070, to join the
Danish fleet and throw off the Norman yoke. And the prospect of
being ousted from his Peterborough lands by a follower of the
new French abbot would have added a personal zest to his patriotic
zeal.</p>

<p>Mr Freeman, followed by Professor Tout,<a id="footnotetagkp17" name="footnotetagkp17"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotekp17"><sup>17</sup></a> holds that the story in
the false Ingulf is not to be wholly cast aside, as it may contain some
genuine Crowland tradition;<a id="footnotetagkp18" name="footnotetagkp18"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotekp18"><sup>18</sup></a> but he has not accurately given that
story. It might hastily be gathered, as it was by him, that it was
Hereward's mother-in-law who 'very considerately takes the veil
at the hands of Abbot Ulfcytel', whereas it was, according to the
<cite>Gesta</cite>, his wife who did this. The <cite>Gesta</cite> version, he writes, 'of Turfrida
going into a monastery to make way for &AElig;lfthryth is plainly
another form of the story in Ingulf, which makes not herself but her
mother do so'. But if the <cite>Historia Ingulphi</cite> (pp. 67-8) be read with
care, it will be seen that 'mater Turfrid<i>&aelig;</i>' should clearly be 'mater
Turfrid<i>a</i>', the reading that the sense requires. So there is here no
opposition, and Ingulf merely follows the <cite>Gesta</cite> version.</p>

<p>As for the honour of Bourne, it can be shown from the <cite>carta</cite> of
Hugh Wac in 1166, from our list of knights, and from the Pipe-Roll
of 1130, to have been formed from separate holdings and to
have descended as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/133-470.png" width="470" height="420" alt="The honour of Bourne" />

<p class="center"> <br />1138<a id="footnotetagkp19" name="footnotetagkp19"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotekp19"><sup>19</sup></a> <br />(see p. <a href="#page359">359</a>)</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg 137]</span></p>

<p>The Psuedo-Ingulf's version runs:</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/134-400.png" width="400" height="327" alt="The Psuedo-Ingulf's version" /></div>

<p>It will be seen how skilfully the author of this famous forgery
brings in the names of real people while confusing their connection
and their dates. Richard de Rullos, for instance, was living shortly
before 1130, yet is here described as living under the Conqueror,
though represented as marrying the great granddaughter of a man
who was himself in the prime of life in 1062. The whole account of
him as an ardent agriculturist, devoted to the improvement of
live-stock and the reclamation of waste, is quaintly anachronistic;
but the fact of his being a friend and benefactor to Crowland is
one for which the writer had probably some ground. For my
part, I attach most importance to his incidental statement that the
daring deeds of Hereward the outlaw, 'adhuc in triviis canuntur',
an allusion, perhaps unnoticed, to a ballad history surviving, it
may be, so late as the days when the forgery was compiled.</p>

<p>But, leaving Hereward, no entries in this list are more deserving
of notice than those which bring before us the famous name of
Nevile:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Gislebertus de Nevila [tenet] ii. carrucatas in Lincolnescira, et servit
Abbati&aelig; pro ii. hidis et inde inventi i. militem (p. 171).</p>

<p>Radulfus de Nevila [tenet] x. carrucatas in Lincolnescira et i. hidam et
dimidiam in Hamtonascira et servit se tercio milite (p. 175).
</p></blockquote>

<p>Hugh Candidus wrote of the former:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Heres Galfridi de Nevile tenet in Lincolnescire, scilicet in Waletone [<i>sic</i>]
justa Folkingham, et Yoltorpe duas carrucatas terra et inde facit plenum
servitium unius militis (p. 59).
</p></blockquote>

<p>With this clue we are enabled to detect Gilbert de Nevile in that
'Gislebertus homo Abbatis', who held of the Abbot (D.B., i. 345<i>b</i>)
at 'Walecote' (Walcot near Folkingham). So also Hugh 'Candidus'
writes of the other Nevile fee:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg 138]</span></p>

<blockquote><p>
Heres Radulfi de Nevile tenet decem carrucatas terr&aelig; in Lincolnshire,
scilicet in Scottone Malmetone; et in Norhamtonscire unam hidam et
dimidiam, scilicet in Holme, Rayniltorp, et inde facit plenum servitium
trium militum (p. 55).
</p></blockquote>

<p>It is, then, Ralf de Nevile that we have in that 'Radulfus homo
Abbatis', who held of him at 'Mameltune', and 'Rageneltorp'
with 'Holm' in Domesday (i. 345<i>b</i>, 346)&mdash;Manton, with Raventhorpe
and Holme (near Bottesford, co. Linc.)&mdash;for Hugh, of course,
has blundered in placing the two latter places in Northamptonshire.<a id="footnotetagkp20" name="footnotetagkp20"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotekp20"><sup>20</sup></a>
The <cite>Testa</cite>, more exact, enables us to add Ashby to Holme and Raventhorpe
as part of one estate, held as a single knight's fee. Scotton, in
the same neighbourhood, was held by 'Ricardus' in Domesday, but,
in the hands of Nevile's heirs, represented a fee and a third.</p>

<p>Between Ralf and Gilbert de Nevile on fo. 346 we find 'Gislebertus
homo Abbatis' holding ten bovates at Hibaldstow. This was the
'Gislebertus Falvel' of our return, not Gilbert de Nevile.</p>

<p>The last Domesday name I shall identify is that of the Abbot's
under-tenant 'Eustacius', who held of him at Polebrook, Clapton
(Northants), and Catworth (Hunts). He was, I believe, the same as
that Eustace who held land, as a tenant-in-chief, at Polebrook,
Northants, and with that Eustace the sheriff ('Vice-comes') who
held (at Catworth, Hunts) also <i>in capite</i>. Indeed the abbot's tenant is
identified with the latter in the story of the foundation of Huntingdon
Priory (<cite>Mon. Ang.</cite>, vi. 78), where, as in our list, we find that his
two knights' fees soon passed to Lovetot.<a id="footnotetagkp21" name="footnotetagkp21"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotekp21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p>We may learn from this identification that two different tenants-in-chief
and at least one under-tenant may prove to be all one man,
just as, on the other hand, we found three distinct Rogers among the
Domesday under-tenants of the Abbot. An additional conclusion is
suggested by the name 'Eustachius de Huntendune', given to this
sheriff in the <cite>Inquisitio Eliensis</cite>.<a id="footnotetagkp22" name="footnotetagkp22"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotekp22"><sup>22</sup></a>
For we find Picot, the Sheriff of
Cambridgeshire, similarly styled in Domesday (i. 200), 'Picot
de Grentebrige'. 'Ilbert de Hertford', I think, was the Sheriff of
Hertfordshire,<a id="footnotetagkp23" name="footnotetagkp23"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotekp23"><sup>23</sup></a>
and Hamo, a contemporary sheriff of Kent, attests
a charter as 'Hamo de Cantuaria'. Turold, sheriff of Lincolnshire,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg 139]</span>
is found as Turold 'of Lincoln' (see p. <a href="#page255">255</a>), and Hugh, sheriff of
Dorset, as Hugh of 'Wareham', while Walter and Miles 'of Gloucester',
Edward and Walter 'of Salisbury', are also cases in point.
Hugh 'of Leicester' was sheriff of Leicestershire <i>temp.</i> Henry I,
while Turchil 'de Warwic' (D.B., i. 240<i>b</i>) may possibly have owed
that appellation to the fact that his father &AElig;lfwine was sheriff of
Warwickshire. Enough, in any case, has been said to show that it
was a regular practice for sheriffs to derive, as often did earls, their
styles from the capital town of their shire.</p>

I am tempted, indeed, to suggest that Hugh may have had before him that
lost local 'account of Hereward's doings', which was inserted (but, according to
my own view, in an abbreviated form) into the earlier chronicle, according to
Professor Earle (see <cite>Norm. Conq.</cite>, iv. 461, note 3). This solution would explain
everything, and would, if accepted, greatly increase the importance of Hugh's
chronicle.</p>

as 'Eustachius Vicecomes' at 'Winewiche' (i. 206), and as 'Eustacius', a tenant of
the Abbot, at 'Winewiche' (i. 221). In the first two cases his under-tenants are
given as 'Widelard[us]' and 'Oilard[us]', doubtless the same man. For 'Winewincle'

<h3>THE WORCESTERSHIRE SURVEY</h3>

<p class="title1c">(<i>Temp.</i> <span class="sc">Henry</span> I)</p>

<p>We have, in the case of the see of Worcester, the means of testing
some of the changes which took place among its tenants within a
generation of Domesday. This is a survey of that portion of its lands
which lay within the county of Worcester. Although printed by
Hearne in his edition of Heming's Cartulary (fos. 141, 141<i>d</i>), it
escaped notice, I believe, till I identified it myself in <cite>Domesday
Studies</cite> (p. 546). As it follows immediately on the transcript of the
Domesday Survey of the fief, the fact that it represents a later and
distinct record might, at first sight, be overlooked.</p>

<p>In spite of the importance of Heming's Cartulary in its bearing on
the Domesday Survey, the documents of which it contains the
transcripts have been hopelessly confused and misunderstood.
Professor Freeman, dealing with them, came to utter grief,<a id="footnotetagw1" name="footnotetagw1"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotew1"><sup>1</sup></a> <!-- w -->
and as for Mr De Gray Birch, he not only took this Survey <i>temp.</i> Henry I
to be a portion of Domesday itself, which 'should be collated with the
original MS. at the Record Office',<a id="footnotetagw2" name="footnotetagw2"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotew2"><sup>2</sup></a> but even repeated Ellis's
blunder,<a id="footnotetagw3" name="footnotetagw3"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotew3"><sup>3</sup></a> that the names in a document
<i>temp.</i> Bishop John [1151-7]<a id="footnotetagw4" name="footnotetagw4"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotew4"><sup>4</sup></a>
represent 'the list of jurors for the Hundred of Oswaldeslaw' at
the Domesday Survey.<a id="footnotetagw5" name="footnotetagw5"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotew5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>From a writ entered on fo. 136 we may infer that there had been
some dispute between the Sheriff and the Church of Worcester as
to the number of hides in the county for which the latter should be
rated.<a id="footnotetagw6" name="footnotetagw6"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotew6"><sup>6</sup></a> This Inquest or Survey was the consequence of that dispute,
and resulted in the issue of the writ. Its date is roughly
determined by the facts that Urse d'Abetot was dead when it was
made, while the Count of Meulan is entered as a tenant, so that
we may probably date it as later (at the earliest) than 1108, and
previous to the death of the Count of Meulan in July 1118.<a id="footnotetagw7" name="footnotetagw7"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotew7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg 141]</span></p>

<p>Let us now compare, Manor by Manor, the earlier with the
later Survey:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Summa hidarum, quas episcopus habet in toto vicecomitatu est ccc. et
quater xx. et xvii. cum his quas Abbas de Evesham tenet de <span class="sc">Oswaldes
Lauue</span>.<a id="footnotetagw10" name="footnotetagw10"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotew10"><sup>10</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>It will be seen that of these 397 hides only 393 are accounted for
above. The explanation is this. Of the five hides held in 'Fepsintune'
by the Church of Worcester in Domesday, only one is entered in
the above list, the other four being wholly omitted, both in the list
itself and in the total. These four omitted hides bring up the 393 to
397, the exact sum that we have to account for.</p>

<p>If the Manors in the above Survey are examined with care
<i>seriatim</i>, it will be found that they bear manifest witness to the
aggressions of Urse d'Abetot, who, we may gather from this Cartulary,
was the <i>b&ecirc;te noire</i> of the Church of Worcester. The various
extensions of his Domesday holdings, as at 'Fledebyrie', where
twelve hides had been increased to twenty-two, were partly due to
the accession of the lands he inherited from his brother, but partly
also to his absorption of the lands of other tenants and of portions
of the episcopal demesne. All the benefit of these accessions passed
to his son-in-law and successor, Walter de Beauchamp.</p>

<p>But perhaps the most important information that this Survey
gives us is to be found in the light it throws on the succession to
Robert 'Dispensator'. That he was brother to Urse d'Abetot is, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg 145]</span>
course, generally known. His relationship to the Marmions is the
<i>crux</i>. I deal with it under the Lindsey Survey,<a id="footnotetagw11" name="footnotetagw11"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotew11"><sup>11</sup></a> which shows us his
Lincolnshire fief in the hands of Roger Marmion. In the present
Survey we find that of the seventeen hides and a half which Robert
Dispensator had held, at the time of Domesday, from the Bishop,
only seven were held by Robert (not Roger) Marmion when this
document was compiled, the rest being held by Walter de Beauchamp.
We thus learn that here, as in Leicestershire, the fief had
been divided between the two.<a id="footnotetagw12" name="footnotetagw12"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotew12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>But this Survey further tells us&mdash;if we may trust the text&mdash;that, in
this succession, Roger Marmion had been preceded by Robert.
One may throw it out as a possible suggestion that, in addition to the
wife of Walter de Beauchamp, Urse d'Abetot may have had a
daughter who married Robert Marmion.<a id="footnotetagw13" name="footnotetagw13"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotew13"><sup>13</sup></a> On the forfeiture of his
son Roger, such a daughter would have pressed her claim, and,
though the inheritance of Urse himself may, by special favour,
have been regranted to Walter, she may have obtained a share of
the fief of her uncle, Robert 'Dispensator'. But this can only be
conjecture.</p>

<p>Of the other points of family history on which this Survey throws
light, one may mention that Hugh 'Puher' had succeeded Walter
'Ponther', that Osbern fitz Richard (of Richard's Castle) had been
succeeded by his son, Hugh fitz Osbern; and that though, as in
1095,<a id="footnotetagw14" name="footnotetagw14"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotew14"><sup>14</sup></a> the name of Hugh de Laci supplants that of his brother
Roger, yet that, if we can trust the text, Roger had in one Manor
been allowed to retain his holding, in accordance with a policy
which is believed to have been practised, namely, that of keeping a
hold, however small, on the forfeited. The name of the Count of
Meulan also, the supplanter of Grentmesnil, will be noticed, and
that of a 'Nicholas', whom, as the successor in a small holding of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg 146]</span>
Robert Despencer, one might perhaps be tempted to identify with
the mysterious Sheriff of Staffordshire, Nicolas de Beauchamp.</p>

<p>There are fragments of two other early surveys relating to
Worcestershire, which, as they contain the names of Walter and of
William de Beauchamp respectively, may be roughly assigned to the
reigns of Henry I and of Stephen. The first, which is found in an
Evesham Cartulary,<a id="footnotetagw15" name="footnotetagw15"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotew15"><sup>15</sup></a> is mainly an abstract of Domesday, but contains
a later and valuable analysis of Droitwich, with an important
reference to the Exchequer. The other<a id="footnotetagw16" name="footnotetagw16"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotew16"><sup>16</sup></a> begins in the middle of a
survey of what seems to be the Church of Worcester's fief, records the
lands held, as under-tenant, by William de Beauchamp, and shows
us the Domesday fief of Ralf de 'Todeni' in the hands of his heir,
Roger de 'Toeni'.</p>

<p>In the former of these two fragments we recognize in John of
Sudeley the younger son of Harold, son of Earl Ralf. It would be of
interest if we might identify his tenant, Richard fitz Robert, with
the younger son of his brother, Robert. The succession in the
tenancy of the Crowland hide (St Guthlac's) needs explanation. In
Domesday (176) Urse held Dunclent of Nigel the physician, who
held both here and at Droitwich under Crowland Abbey. It must
have been through him at Droitwich also that William fitz Richard
became tenant, for Robert fitz William (who was clearly the latter's
son) held here of Walter de Beauchamp in the second fragment.</p>

<p>It is in tracing William de Beauchamp's succession, as under-tenant
to his grandfather Urse, that we find the chief interest of the
second fragment. He has succeeded him, for instance, as tenant to
the Abbeys of Westminster, Pershore, and Coventry (the fief of the
last having now become that of 'the Bishop of Chester'). At Wadborough,
however, it was Robert 'Dispensator' whom he had
succeeded as tenant of Pershore. In one case we find him holding of
Robert fitz Erchembald, whose Domesday predecessor we thus
learn was William Goizenboded (177<i>b</i>). We may also note his tenure
of Madresfield (now Lord Beauchamp's seat)&mdash;the earliest mention,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg 148]</span>
I think, of the place&mdash;as a limb of Powick. Fulk Paynell, of whom
William held at Beoley, had now succeeded to the Domesday fief of
William fitz Ansculf, whose tenant 'Robert' may have been Robert
'Dispensator'. Osbern fitz Hugh had similarly succeeded to the
Richard's Castle fief held, in Domesday, by his grandfather.</p>

<p>I append a partial comparison of Domesday with the Henry I
survey so far as concerns Droitwich, where property, owing to its
value, was divided among many owners.</p>

We are enabled by this Survey, and by the division it records, to carry up
the history of Elmley, the original seat of the Beauchamps, to Domesday itself.
The great Manor of Cropthorne, by Evesham, was held by the Church of Worcester.
In Bengeworth, one of its 'members', Urse d'Abetot, had seized an estate of five
hides (<cite>Heming's Cartulary</cite> fo. 125<i>b</i>). His brother, Robert Despencer, had seized two
other 'members', Charlton ('Ceorlatuna') and Elmley (<cite>Ibid.</cite>). In Domesday we are
merely told that Robert held eleven hides in Cropthorne. But the present Survey
fortunately mentions that the portion which fell to Marmion's share was seven
hides in 'Charlton'. This leaves four hides for Elmley, which, added to the five
hides of Urse d'Abetot in Bengeworth, makes exactly the nine hides here entered to
Walter de Beauchamp. We thus learn how the Beauchamps became possessed of
Elmley. And this calculation is confirmed by the entry in the <cite>Testa</cite> (p. 41):
'Willelmus de Bello Campo ... in Elmeleg in dominico iiij. hidas.'</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="footnotew13" name="footnotew13"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotetagw13"><sup>13</sup></a>
It is worth noting that we find, in Domesday, both a Robert and a Walter
holding of Urse in Worcestershire.</p>

<h3>THE LINDSEY SURVEY</h3>

<p class="title1c">(1115-18)</p>

<p>This 'invaluable Survey', as Mr Stevenson has termed it,<a id="footnotetaglin1" name="footnotetaglin1"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelin1"><sup>1</sup></a> <!-- lin -->
might be described as a miniature Domesday for each of the Wapentakes in
the three trithings into which Lindsey was divided. For although
drawn up, Wapentake by Wapentake, as is the Leicestershire
Survey, Hundred by Hundred, the lands within each Wapentake
described are grouped under the names of the holders of fiefs,
instead of being entered Vill by Vill. It was doubtless compiled, like
other surveys, in connection with the assessment of the 'geld'.<a id="footnotetaglin2" name="footnotetaglin2"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelin2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>Remarkable from a palaeographic standpoint, as well as from the
nature of its contents, the record, which is found in a Cottonian
MS. (Claud. C. 5), has been singularly unfortunate in its editors.
As Mr Greenstreet truly observed:</p>

<blockquote><p>
The indefatigable Hearne, seeing that the manuscript related to a very
ancient period of our history, and recognizing its great importance, printed
it in the Appendix to his 'Liber Niger', but he does not appear to have
properly examined either the question of the date of the writing, or the
internal evidence.... As a natural consequence of his superficial examination,
he associates it wrongly with the reign of Henry II.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Stapleton, of course, knew better than this, and assigned the survey
at one time to <i>circ.</i> 1108,<a id="footnotetaglin3" name="footnotetaglin3"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelin3"><sup>3</sup></a> but in his
<cite>Rotuli Scaccarii Normanni&aelig;</cite><a id="footnotetaglin4" name="footnotetaglin4"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelin4"><sup>4</sup></a> to
1106-20. It was subsequently investigated and analysed with great
care by Mr Eyton, whose note-books, now in the British Museum,
show that he adopted the sound method of comparing it in detail
with Domesday Book. After his death Mr Chester Waters issued
(1883) an annotated translation of the text, with an introduction,
analysis, etc., in which the place-names were carefully identified,
and the same system of comparison with Domesday adopted.<a id="footnotetaglin5" name="footnotetaglin5"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelin5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>It is, unfortunately, necessary to explain that Mr Waters in the
table of contents described his translation as 'from the Cotton MS.,
Claudius C. 5', and wrote on the opposite page:</p>

<blockquote><p>
This MS. engaged the attention of Thomas Hearne, the antiquary, who
has printed it amongst the additaments to his edition of the <cite>Liber Niger
Scaccarii</cite>; but Hearne was one of those industrious but uncritical antiquaries
who had no conception of the duties of an editor of the importance of
accuracy.
</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg 150]</span></p>

<p>Knowing the high opinion entertained of Mr Waters' works,<a id="footnotetaglin6" name="footnotetaglin6"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelin6"><sup>6</sup></a>
I accepted his translation in all good faith as 'from the Cotton MS.'
and was, I confess, not a little startled to discover from Mr Greenstreet's
facsimiles that it was made not from the Cotton MS., but
from that inaccurate edition by Hearne, which Mr Waters had
mentioned only to denounce. On fo. 4<i>b</i> a whole line, containing three
entries, was accidentally omitted by Hearne, and is, consequently,
absent also from Mr Waters' version. On collating the two, however,
I found, to my great surprise, that matters were even worse than
this, and that Hearne's text was far less inaccurate than Mr Waters'
own, the erroneous figures found in the latter being almost always
correctly given by the 'uncritical' Hearne. As for the version given
by Mr Waters, even in the very first Wapentake, there are three
serious errors, five carucates being given as three, nine as seven,
and eleven as two! And for Bradley Wapentake (p. 27), his figures
are so erroneous that, according to him, 'Radulf Meschin alone had
42 cars. 6 bovs. in this Wapentake', though his real holding was
only fifteen cars. three bovs. With another class of resultant errors I
shall have to deal below.</p>

<p>To the enterprise of Mr Greenstreet scholars were indebted for
an <i>&eacute;dition de luxe</i> of the record in facsimile, which made its appearance
shortly after the treatise of Mr Waters. Unfortunately, no
attempt was made in the appended literal translation to identify
the names of places or persons, while such a word as '[ap]pendiciis',
which occasionally appears in the survey, is mistaken for a place-name
'Pendicus'. The book enjoys, however, the great advantage of
an index.</p>

<p>The identification of places and of persons in Mr Waters' treatise
shows extraordinary knowledge; but both Mr Eyton and Mr Waters
had the provoking habit of making important assertions without giving
their authority. I expressed a wish in the <cite>Academy</cite>, at the time,
that Mr Waters would give us some clue as to his sources of information,
but as he did not think fit to do so, we have to test his statements
as best we can for ourselves. Now we learn from him on p. 36 that
'Walter fitz William', a tenant at South Willingham, was 'brother
of Simon mentioned above', namely of 'Simon fitz William (ancestor
to the Lords Kyme)'. This is impressive until we discover that the
actual words in the survey (as indeed in Hearne's text) are 'Walt[erius]
fil[ius] Walt[eri]i' (fo. 11 <i>b</i>).<a id="footnotetaglin7" name="footnotetaglin7"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelin7"><sup>7</sup></a> To an expert such a test as this
will prove significant enough. But to turn from an actual misreading
of the text to cases in which are incorporated interlineations, not
part of the original text, but written in later times, we find Mr
Waters&mdash;like other antiquaries who had followed Hearne's text&mdash;stating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg 151]</span>
that 'Ranulf [Meschin] is twice styled in the Roll Earl of
Lincoln, but there is no record of his creation, and no other authority
for possession of the earldom' (p. 8). The difficulty vanishes when
we discover that this supposed style was a mere interlineation made
by a much later hand.<a id="footnotetaglin8" name="footnotetaglin8"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelin8"><sup>8</sup></a> So again we read on p. 30:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Richard, Earl [of Chester], has 6 cars. in Barnetby-le-Wold, where
[William], the constable of Chester, is his tenant [as his father was Earl
Hugh's in Domesday].
</p></blockquote>

<p>But on turning to Mr Greenstreet's facsimiles, we find that the
survey had nothing about 'the constable of Chester', the words 'constabularia
[<i>sic</i>] Cestrie' being only a faint interlineation by a later
hand.</p>

<p>And even where a reference to the true text does not at once dispose
of the matter, these statements of Mr Waters are, on other
grounds, open at times to question. He assumes, for instance, that
Hugh fitz Ranulf, who occurs as a landowner in the survey, was a
younger son of Ranulf Meschin, afterwards Earl of Chester (p. 12).
No such son would seem to be known; and this assumption, moreover,
does violence to chronology. For the pedigree it involves is this:</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/148-436.png" width="436" height="193" alt="pedigree" /></div>

<p>Now William de Roumare was not old enough to claim his inheritance
from the King till 1122, and his half-brother, Ranulf, was some
years younger than he was, as the words of Orderic imply in 1140.
Consequently Hugh, the youngest brother, can have been only a boy
in 1122. How then could he, as Mr Waters alleges, have held a fief in
right of his wife so early as 1115 or thereabouts?</p>

<p>In this assumption, however, he only follows Stapleton, to whom
he here refers, and who relied on an abstract in the cartulary of
Spalding (fol. 416 <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>). This abstract which cannot, from its form,
preserve the wording of the original charter, runs:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Sciant tam presentes quam futuri quod Hugo frater Rannulfi comitis
Cestrie et Matild' uxor ejus, fil' filia [<i>sic</i>] Lucie comitisse concesserunt,
etc., etc.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Stapleton boldly rendered the obviously corrupt words as 'son and
daughter-in-law of the countess Lucia',<a id="footnotetaglin9" name="footnotetaglin9"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelin9"><sup>9</sup></a> and hence pronounced this
Hugh to be 'a married brother of the whole blood' to the <em>second</em>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg 152]</span>
Randulf, Earl of Chester.<a id="footnotetaglin10" name="footnotetaglin10"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelin10"><sup>10</sup></a> As he only knew their gift to Spalding to
be 'prior to 1141', no chronological difficulty was caused by this
view; but the occurrence of Hugh's name in the Lindsey Survey, as
already in possession of his small fief, at once raises the difficulty I
have explained. The solution that occurs to me is that the Hugh fitz
Ranulf of our survey, and the 'Hugo frater Ranulfi Comitis Cestrie'
of the Spalding charter, was a brother, not of the second but of the
<em>first</em> Earl Ranulf, and that the words 'fil' filia Comitisse Lucie' were
introduced in error by the compiler, whose head was full of the
Countess Lucy, and who had here confused the two Earls Randulf.</p>

<p>Stapleton, Mr Waters has justly observed, was '<i>facile princeps</i> of
Anglo-Norman genealogists'.<a id="footnotetaglin11" name="footnotetaglin11"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelin11"><sup>11</sup></a> Yet I venture to think that, as he
here mistook a brother of the first Earl Ranulf for a son, so he confused
William Meschin, another and better known brother, with
William de Roumare, the Earl's stepson, afterwards Earl of Lincoln.
William Meschin was not merely a considerable landowner in Lindsey,
but had also estates in Northamptonshire and Leicestershire, as
our survey of those counties show.<a id="footnotetaglin12" name="footnotetaglin12"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelin12"><sup>12</sup></a> Stephen, according to Stapleton,
created him Earl of Cambridge.</p>

<p>Remembering the <i>dictum</i> of Dr Stubbs that 'Stephen's earldoms
are a matter of great constitutional importance', it is worth while to
examine this earldom of Cambridge.</p>

<p>In one of Stapleton's greatest essays, that on Holy Trinity Priory,
York,<a id="footnotetaglin13" name="footnotetaglin13"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelin13"><sup>13</sup></a> he writes of this William Meschin, that</p>

<blockquote><p>
By King Stephen he was made Earl of Cambridge, as we learn from the
following extract from a charter of Alexander, Bishop of Lincoln, in 1139,
founding the nunnery of Haverholm, in the parish of Ruskington, of the
order of St. Gilbert of Sempringham. 'But this donation ... we have confirmed
... by the testimony of Rannulph, Earl of Chester, and of William,
Earl of Cambridge, his brother' (p. 34).
</p></blockquote>

<p>The words in the original are:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Testimonio Rannulfi comitis Cestri&aelig; et Willelmi comitis Cantebrigi&aelig;
fratris ejus (<cite>Mon. Ang.</cite>, v. 949).
</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, though Stapleton is positive on the point, speaking again of
'William Meschin, Earl of Cambridge' (p. 35), and though this
learned paper well sustains his reputation, yet he has here beyond
question gone astray. Earl Randulf, first of his name, appears as
deceased in the Pipe Roll of 1130. He could not therefore have been
the Earl Randulf of 1139, who was his son and namesake. Therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg 153]</span>
the latter's 'brother', the Earl of Cambridge, could not have been
William Meschin, who was his father's brother.<a id="footnotetaglin14" name="footnotetaglin14"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelin14"><sup>14</sup></a> A short chart pedigree
will make the matter clear:</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/150-550.png" width="550" height="390" alt="pedigree" /></div>

<p>The pedigree shows my solution of the mystery. The two brother-earls
of 1139 are those who are found so constantly together, and
who were jointly concerned, next year, in the surprise of Lincoln,
but who were really only <em>half</em>-brothers, though they spoke of one
another as 'frater'.</p>

<p>The identity of the 'Earl of Cambridge' is thus clearly established;
but there of course remains the question why he is not here styled
'Earl of Lincoln'. Every mention of him as Earl of Lincoln is later, if
this charter be rightly dated, so that he may possibly have changed
his style. It is really strange that precisely as William, Earl of Lincoln,
is here once styled Earl of Cambridge, so William, Earl of
Arundel, is twice styled Earl of Lincoln, as I have shown in my
<cite>Geoffrey de Mandeville</cite> (p. 324), though in that case also the fact had
never been suspected. It is most tempting, if rash, to suggest that the
reason why the Earl of Lincoln was at first Earl of Cambridge is that
the Earl of Arundel (Sussex) was at first Earl of Lincoln, and thus
kept him out of that title.</p>

<p>In any case an error has now been corrected, and one of Stephen's
alleged earls disposed of.</p>

<p>The question of the date of this interesting survey is no less puzzling
than important. Mr Greenstreet held that 'there is hardly any
room for doubting' that it was previous to 1109. This conclusion was
based on a misapprehension, and Mr Waters claimed to have
'established' the date as 'between March 1114 and April 1116'
(pp. 2-4). In this conclusion he would seem to have been anticipated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg 154]</span>
by Mr Eyton, as is shown by that writer's note-books,<a id="footnotetaglin15" name="footnotetaglin15"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelin15"><sup>15</sup></a> but I cannot
accept the identical and somewhat far-fetched argument on which
they relied. They obtained their limit on the one hand from a passage
in 'Peter of Blois', and on the other from the fact that Robert,
the King's son, is entered in the roll as 'filius Regis', and 'was therefore
not yet Earl of Gloucester', whereas he was certainly Earl, they
say, 'before Easter, 1116', when he witnessed as Earl, a charter they
both assign to that date.</p>

<p>Of the latter date I disposed in my paper 'The Creation of the
Earldom of Gloucester',<a id="footnotetaglin16" name="footnotetaglin16"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelin16"><sup>16</sup></a> in which I showed that Robert did not
become Earl till several years later. The other evidence, if it cannot
be disproved, cannot at least, be relied on. For, without asserting
that the chronicle assigned to 'Peter of Blois' is so daring a forgery
as the 'Historia Ingulphi', of which it is a 'continuatio', it must be
plainly described as absolutely untrustworthy. Apart from the passage
on Cambridge University,<a id="footnotetaglin17" name="footnotetaglin17"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelin17"><sup>17</sup></a> we have a description 'Inclyti
Comitis Leycestri&aelig; Roberti tunc validissimi adolescentis, burgensiumque
su&aelig; dict&aelig; civitatis' in 1113, and of his presence, with his
knights, at the laying of the Abbey foundation stones next year.<a id="footnotetaglin18" name="footnotetaglin18"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelin18"><sup>18</sup></a>
Now the future Earl of Leicester was some nine years old at the
time, and his father, the Count of Meulan, lived till 1118. So also,
about the year 1114 we meet with 'Milonis Comitis Herfordensis',
who did not become Earl of Hereford till 1141, and whose father,
Walter of Gloucester, was living long after 1114; while on the next
page we find the notoriously false Countess Lucy legend, with the
additional blunder of converting her son, the Earl of Lincoln, into
her husband's brother!<a id="footnotetaglin19" name="footnotetaglin19"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelin19"><sup>19</sup></a> It is in the midst of all this that we have the
vital passage on which Mr Waters relies:</p>

<blockquote><p>
We know from the <cite>Continuator</cite> [<i>sic</i>] <cite>of Peter of Blois</cite> (p. 121) that Stephen
and his elder brother Theobald were on a visit to Henry I, at Oxford, at
some period between March 7th and August 1st, 1114, when Theobald is
described as Count of Blois, and Stephen as 'pulcherrimus adolescens
dominus postea rex Anglorum'. It is manifest that at this date Stephen was
not yet Count of Moreton, so the Roll must be later than March 7th, 1114
(p. 3).
</p></blockquote>

<p>The fact that this alleged visit is connected by 'Peter' with intervention
in favour of the Abbot of Crowland, will not lessen the suspicion
under which the evidence must lie. Crowland was guilty of 'hiring',
Dr Stubbs has severely observed, 'Peter of Blois, or some pretended
Peter who borrows an illustrious name, to fabricate for her an
apocryphal chronicle'.<a id="footnotetaglin20" name="footnotetaglin20"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelin20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg 155]</span></p>

<p>The actual proof of the survey's date is minute, no doubt, but
conclusive. In the Lindsey Survey, 'the sons of Ragemer' (himself
the Domesday under-tenant) are found holding of Walter de Gant;
therefore their father, at the time of the survey, had been succeeded
by them in this holding. But, as 'Rachmar, son of Gilbert', he is
found attesting a charter of Maud, Walter de Gant's wife, to Bridlington
Priory, which is addressed to Thurstan, Archbishop of York,
and which therefore must be later at the very least than his election,
August 15, 1114. Therefore Ragemer was alive after that date,
and the survey, at the time of which he was dead, can consequently
scarcely be earlier than 1115. On the other hand, we can scarcely
place it later than the death of the great Count of Meulan in the
summer of 1118,<a id="footnotetaglin21" name="footnotetaglin21"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelin21"><sup>21</sup></a> though, as I have urged in the <cite>Genealogist</cite>, the
lands he had held might still be assigned to 'the Count of Meulan',
till his fiefs were divided among his sons, who were boys at the time
of his death. On the whole we may safely assign the survey to 1115-1118,
and in any case it cannot possibly be later than the close of
1120.</p>

<p>As, according to Stapleton, the best authority, it is in this survey
that the name of Marmion first appears in England, it may not be
inopportune to examine here the accepted pedigree of that house.
In the Roger Marmion of our survey we have its undoubted ancestor,
but of Robert Marmion, who appears on its opening folio as a
tenant of Walter de Gant at Winteringham, one cannot speak so
positively. In Domesday Winteringham, as 12 carucates, was held
of Gilbert de Gant by 'Robertus homo Gilberti' (354<i>b</i>): in our Survey
eleven<a id="footnotetaglin22" name="footnotetaglin22"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelin22"><sup>22</sup></a> of these carucates were held of Gilbert's son Walter by
Robert Marmion, and the twelfth <i>in capite</i> by Roger Marmion. Mr
Waters (p. 17) identifies the former with the Domesday under-tenant,
which is a tempting solution, were not the Domesday Robert
also under-tenant at Risby (which was held in our survey not by
Marmion, but by Walter de St Paul). It seems to me more probable
that Robert, the under-tenant in our survey, was, as Mr Waters,
contradicting himself, elsewhere observes (p. 14), the son and heir of
Roger. Yet of Roger Marmion's estate at Fulstow, Mr Waters writes
(p. 27): 'Roger's father, Robert Marmion, was tenant there in
Domesday of Robert Dispenser.' This would give us an interesting
clue. But on turning to Domesday (363<i>b</i>), we find that it is only one
more mistake of Mr Waters, its 'Robertus' being no other than
Robert Dispenser himself.<a id="footnotetaglin23" name="footnotetaglin23"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelin23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg 156]</span></p>

<p>Stapleton, who worked out the descent, held that Roger's son
Robert, who had succeeded by 1130, and who was slain in 1143, was
father of the Robert who died in 1218. I would rather interpolate
another Robert between the two:</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/153-450.png" width="450" height="613" alt="pedigree" /></div>

<p>The pedigree really turns on the charter of Henry III in 1249, to
Philip Marmion, confirming the royal charters to his ancestor. Mr
Stapleton declares that Henry inspected and confirmed</p>

<blockquote><p>
The charter which King Henry, his great-great-grandfather, had made
to Robert Marmyon, great-grandfather of Philip Marmyon, of having
warren in all his land in the county of Warwick, and especially at Tamworth;
and likewise of the charter of King Henry, his uncle ['Avunculus
noster' is the reading transcribed on the rolls, obviously in error of 'atavus
noster'], which he had made to the said Robert of having warren in all his
land of Lindesay (<cite>Rot. Scacc. Norm.</cite>, II. cvi.).
</p></blockquote>

<p>This abstract is strangely inaccurate, considering that Stapleton had,
clearly, examined the Inspeximus<a id="footnotetaglin24" name="footnotetaglin24"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelin24"><sup>24</sup></a> for himself. Henry VI inspected
and confirmed:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg 157]</span></p>

<ul class="none">
  <li>(1)  The charter of Henry I, granting Robert Marmion freewarren
  in Warwickshire (specially at Tamworth) as his father had.</li>

<li>(2)  The charter of Henry II (confirming the above charter),
  'T. Tom. Canc. apud Brugiam', and therefore granted in 1155.</li>

<li>(3)  The charter of Henry III, who had inspected&mdash;
<ul class="none">
<li>(<i>a</i>)  'Cartam quam Henr' rex avus [<i>sic</i>] noster [<i>i.e</i>. Henry II]
          fecit Roberto Marmyon proavo Philippi Marmyun';</li>

<li>(<i>b</i>)  'Cartam Henrici regis avunculi nostri quam fecit Roberto';
  and confirmed them as the charters, 'H. Regis avi nostri et H. regis
  avunculi nostri', to Philip Marmion.</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<p>It is clear then that Henry III inspected the charter of his grandfather
('avus') Henry II (not, as Mr Stapleton wrote, his great-great-grandfather'),
in 1155, to Robert Marmion, '<i>proavus</i>' of
Philip. This, it will be seen, could only be the Robert whom I
have inserted in the pedigree. Nor can Mr Stapleton's 'atavus'
assumption be accepted in view of the facts. The 'avunculus' and
namesake of Henry III would duly have been the 'young king'
Henry (crowned 1170). If 'avunculus' is a clerical error, the word
to substitute is 'avus'; but the careful way in which the charter
distinguishes the King's two predecessors is quite opposed to the
idea that they were in both cases his grandfather.</p>

<p>As against the evidence afforded us by the charter of Henry III,
we have the statements and documents relating to Barbery Abbey, a
daughter of Savigny. It is alleged that the house was first founded in
1140<a id="footnotetaglin25" name="footnotetaglin25"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelin25"><sup>25</sup></a> by that Robert Marmion who was slain at Coventry in
1143.<a id="footnotetaglin26" name="footnotetaglin26"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelin26"><sup>26</sup></a> Stapleton accepted this without question. Yet, so far as
documents are concerned, we have only the charter of Robert
Marmion (1181), in which he speaks of his father Robert as beginning
the foundation.<a id="footnotetaglin27" name="footnotetaglin27"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelin27"><sup>27</sup></a> If that father were indeed the Robert who
was slain in 1143, Stapleton's pedigree is duly proved as against that
which I derive from Henry the Third's charter. But for this identification
we have only, it would seem, the <i>obiter dictum</i> of the 'Gallia
Christiana' editors, while the fact that the first Abbot was appointed
about 1177,<a id="footnotetaglin28" name="footnotetaglin28"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelin28"><sup>28</sup></a> combined with the fact that Robert Marmion, in
1181, was avowedly completing that foundation which his father's
death had arrested, certainly seems to point to his father's benefaction
being then recent, and little previous to the said appointment
of the first Abbot. In that case his father would be not the
Robert who died in 1143, but a Robert who, as I suggest, came
between the two.<a id="footnotetaglin29" name="footnotetaglin29"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelin29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg 158]</span></p>

<p>Leaving now this question of pedigree, there is a theory as to the
name of Marmion which one cannot pass over in silence, because it
has received the sanction even of Stapleton. Writing on the date of
the Lindsey Survey, that eminent authority observes:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Robert Le Despenser [<em>Dispensator</em>] was brother of Urso de Abbetot, whose
other surname, Marmion, is equivalent in Norman French to the Latin
word Dispensator; and as Robert Marmion died in 1107, it was probably
in the following year that this catalogue was written.<a id="footnotetaglin30" name="footnotetaglin30"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelin30"><sup>30</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>His meaning, though clumsily expressed, as was sometimes the case,
is that the Latin 'Dispensator' represented the name 'Marmion'.
This theory would seem to be derived from the word 'Marmiton'
(not 'Marmion') which means not a 'Dispensator', but a scullion,
the most despised of the menials employed in the kitchen. There
was indeed in old French a rare word 'Marmion', but according to
Godefroy, it was equivalent to 'Marmot', the name of the Marmoset.
In any case, therefore, this illustrious surname, immortalized by
Scott</p>

<div class="poem width21"><div class="stanza">
<p>They hailed him Lord of Fontenaye,</p>
<p>Of Lutterworth and Scrivelbaye,</p>
<p class="i2">Of Tamworth tower and town</p>
</div></div>

<p>had nothing to do with 'Dispensator', but meant either a scullion
or a monkey, and was one of those nicknames that the Normans
loved to inexorably bestow on one another.</p>

<p>What was the actual relation of the Marmions to Robert 'Dispensator'
is a problem as yet unsolved. Mr Waters wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>
It is generally believed that Scrivelsby and the rest of the Honour of
Dispenser came to the Marmions through the marriage of Roger Marmion's
grandson,<a id="footnotetaglin31" name="footnotetaglin31"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelin31"><sup>31</sup></a> Robert Marmion, who was the husband of Matilda de Beauchamp,
the grand-daughter of Urso de Abitot, and grand-niece of Robert
Dispenser. But the Roll proves that Roger Marmion was the immediate
heir of Robert Dispenser (p. 14).
</p></blockquote>

<p>I know of no such general belief. Stapleton, to whom one would
naturally turn, had pointed out long before, in his 'Rolls of the
Norman Exchequer', that this survey proves Roger Marmion to
have held the Lincolnshire fief of Robert 'Dispensator',<a id="footnotetaglin32" name="footnotetaglin32"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelin32"><sup>32</sup></a> while those
who have identified the latter magnate with Robert 'Marmion' have
traced the descent of Scrivelsby in the Marmions even from the
Conquest.<a id="footnotetaglin33" name="footnotetaglin33"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelin33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg 159]</span></p>

<p>In any case, as I wrote in my <cite>Ancient Charters</cite> (1888) of a document
there published:</p>

<blockquote><p>
The succession of Urse [de Abetot] to this [Lincolnshire] fief is a genealogical
discovery which throws a wholly new light on the very difficult
problem of the relation of Marmion to Despenser, and is fatal to the assertion
of Mr Chester Waters that 'Roger Marmion was the immediate heir of
Robert Dispenser'.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Moreover, in the Leicestershire Survey,<a id="footnotetaglin34" name="footnotetaglin34"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelin34"><sup>34</sup></a> and still more in that of
Worcestershire,<a id="footnotetaglin35" name="footnotetaglin35"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelin35"><sup>35</sup></a> we have evidence that Robert's inheritance was
shared between Beauchamp and Marmion which points there also
to descent through Urse de Abetot. In my <cite>Geoffrey de Mandeville</cite>
(pp. 313-5) I have suggested that in their rivalry for Tamworth,<a id="footnotetaglin36" name="footnotetaglin36"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelin36"><sup>36</sup></a>
the Marmions embraced the cause of Stephen, and the Beauchamps
that of Maud, their variance being terminated under Henry II by
a matrimonial alliance. Such a compromise was common enough.
It was agreed on in the case of Grantmesnil; it was carried out at
this very period in that of Fitzharding and Berkeley; it was again
resorted to at a later stage in the history of the house of Berkeley;
it was arranged in the case of Hastings; and it was repeated in that
of Boleyn, where the Butler inheritance was at stake.<a id="footnotetaglin37" name="footnotetaglin37"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelin37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

It is certain that Tamworth originally belonged to Robert 'Dispensator',
and equally certain that it was held successively by Roger and Robert Marmion
under Henry I.</p>

<h3>THE LEICESTERSHIRE SURVEY</h3>

<p class="title1c">(1124-29).</p>

<p>Asserting the importance of the Lindsey Survey, Mr Chester
Waters observed that 'this is the sole record of its kind which deals
with the interval between the completion of Domesday in 1086,
and the compilation of the Pipe-Roll of 1129-30, and that no similar
return of the landowners of any other county is known to exist'
(p. 2). And, indeed, it would seem that the survey to which I now
address myself has hitherto remained unknown. It is found in the
form of a late transcript on an unidentified roll in the Public Record
Office.<a id="footnotetaglei1" name="footnotetaglei1"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelei1"><sup>1</sup></a></p><!-- lei -->

<p>Comprising the whole of Gosecote Wapentake, and in part those
of Framland and Gartree, it retains for these divisions the Domesday
name of Wapentake&mdash;they are now 'Hundreds'&mdash;while subdividing
them into small 'Hundreds', of which the existence seems
to have been hitherto unsuspected. Proceeding, like the I.C.C.,
'Hundred' by 'Hundred', and Vill by Vill, it enables us, like that
document, to reconstitute the aggregate assessments, and thus
affords priceless evidence on 'the six-carucate unit'.<a id="footnotetaglei2" name="footnotetaglei2"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelei2"><sup>2</sup></a> But apart from
this, it is invested with no small importance from that 'great want of
documentary evidence' for the reign of Henry I which Mr Hunter
rightly lamented in his elaborate introduction to the first great roll
of the Pipe (p. ii). It affords us new and trustworthy evidence on the
many vicissitudes of the great fiefs, and enables us, while tracing the
fortunes of their owners, to see how the first Henry provided for his
<i>novi homines</i>, showering escheats and royal demesne on the trusty
officials he had raised 'from the dust', as well as on his favourite
nephew, Stephen, Count of Mortain.</p>

<p>The date of this survey is thus determined. The frequent mention
of 'Rex D[avid]' places it subsequent to his accession to the throne
in April 1124. On the other hand, the name of Ralf Basset (the
justiciar) shows it to be anterior to his death; and he was dead
before Mich., 1130 (<cite>Rot. Pip.</cite>, 31 Hen. I). Moreover, it speaks more
than once of Hugh de Leicester as 'Vicecomes', and Hugh's shrievalty
seems from the Pipe-Roll to have terminated at Mich., 1129.
We may therefore place this survey between the spring of 1124
and the autumn of 1129, with a likelihood of its having been
compiled nearer the latter date.</p>

<p class="title1d">[FINIS.]</p>

<p>The work of identifying the places named in this survey is
difficult, not only from the corruption of the text, but also from the
fact that many of them are only obscure names, needing, for their
perfect ascertainment, local knowledge. A careful study of the map
will show that these Leicestershire 'Hundreds', unlike those to which
we are accustomed in the hidated districts, were strangely intermingled
among themselves. Another of their peculiarities is that
just as we find the reconquered 'shires' named each after its capital
town, so these 'Hundreds' were each named after one of their Vills
instead of after some natural object&mdash;probably the meeting-place
of the primitive moot<a id="footnotetaglei44" name="footnotetaglei44"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelei44"><sup>44</sup></a>
&mdash;as so often in the south of England.</p>

<p>It is important to observe that, except for this survey, we should
not even have known of the existence of these 'Hundreds' in Leicestershire.
And when we compare the entry on our roll&mdash;'Framelaund
Wap'. Hundredum de Calevertone. In eadem villa xii. car.'&mdash;with
that in the Derbyshire Domesday: 'Morelestan Wepentac.
Salle Hundred. In Salle et Draicot et Opewelle ... xii. car.' (i. 273),
it is scarcely possible to resist the conclusion that, in this passage
relating to Sawley, divided only by a river from Leicestershire, we
have a glimpse of the same system existing in Derbyshire also.
That is to say, that Sawley was not a 'Hundred' of twelve carucates,<a id="footnotetaglei45" name="footnotetaglei45"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelei45"><sup>45</sup></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg 166]</span>
as has been suggested,<a id="footnotetaglei46" name="footnotetaglei46"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelei46"><sup>46</sup></a>
but was the <i>caput</i> of a 'Hundred'
similar to those of Leicestershire. I believe, indeed, that in our
survey we see the system on which these counties were surveyed in
1086. The original returns will have been drawn up Wapentake by
Wapentake, and 'Hundred' by 'Hundred'. But when transcribed
into Domesday Book the entries were arranged under Wapentakes
alone, and the headings of the 'Hundreds' omitted. In the case of
Sawley alone the heading slipped in, immediately preceding the
entry of the Manor, as it must have done on the original return. It
is thus that I account for the mention of 'leets' slipping into the
Norfolk Domesday, in two cases, from the original return;<a id="footnotetaglei47" name="footnotetaglei47"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelei47"><sup>47</sup></a>
just as, in Cambridgeshire, the total assessments of Impington and
Chatteris have slipped, from the original returns, into the <cite>Inq.
Eliensis</cite>,<a id="footnotetaglei48" name="footnotetaglei48"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelei48"><sup>48</sup></a> though duly omitted in Domesday Book.</p>

<p>One more point should be noticed. The somewhat mysterious
entry of land belonging 'ad defensionem de Swepestone' is at once
made clear when we compare it with that 'Defensio x. acrarum',
to which I have appealed<a id="footnotetaglei49" name="footnotetaglei49"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelei49"><sup>49</sup></a> in discussing 'Wara', and which, like the
'wered' of the Northamptonshire geld-roll,<a id="footnotetaglei50" name="footnotetaglei50"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelei50"><sup>50</sup></a> refers to assessment
for Danegeld.</p>

<p>We will now collate some of our 'Hundreds' with the relative
entries in Domesday.</p>

<p>In the case of this last Hundred our survey records a conflict of
testimony and, in so doing, mentions incidentally (as would Domesday)
the witness of the Hundred-court. Henry de Ferrers in the
Domesday Survey, is credited with 21&frac12; car. in 'Tunge cum omnibus
appendiciis', and with four in 'Werditone' (i. 233). But here Tong,
'cum appendiciis', is reckoned at twelve car. only. There remained,
therefore, to be accounted for a large balance of car., and these
the men of the Hundred assigned to his Manor of Worthington.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[pg 171]</span>
It is desirable to analyse some of the fiefs in our survey, and, by
comparison with Domesday, to trace their descent or origin.</p>

<p>The fief of Richard Basset is that of a typical man, of one of those
trusted officials who flourished under Henry I. We know not
the fate of Robert de Buci, a Domesday baron in Leicestershire
and Northants; but as two, at least, of his Leicestershire estates
passed, we have seen, to Mowbray, it was, we may infer, forfeiture or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg 173]</span>
escheat that brought his fief into the king's hands, and enabled him
to divide it among his own favourites. We learn from the evidence
to which I am coming that the eight carucates in Swinford and
Walcote, and the two in little Ashby which Robert de Buci had held
in 1086, were in the hands of Geoffrey Ridel ninety years later.
We may then infer, though they are not included in the sphere of
our survey, that they had been obtained, like the rest, by Basset
<i>temp.</i> Hen. I.<a id="footnotetaglei56" name="footnotetaglei56"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelei56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>

<p>The elaborate fine made at Leicester, <ins title="See Transcriber's Note at end.">June 31</ins>, 1176,<a id="footnotetaglei57" name="footnotetaglei57"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelei57"><sup>57</sup></a>
has an important
bearing on the Bassets' Leicestershire possessions. Not only
does it specify the lands they held at Swinford (with Walcote),
Ashby, and Fleckney, but it mentions their fee of Madeley, Staffordshire.
Now the descent of this Staffordshire fee can be traced by
charters on the same roll.<a id="footnotetaglei58" name="footnotetaglei58"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelei58"><sup>58</sup></a>
One of these (No. 12) is a confirmation,
by Robert de Stafford, of Madeley to Geoffrey Ridel, to be
held as his 'antecessores' had held it. This was Geoffrey, son of
Richard Basset, by Maud Ridel, as is shown by the fact that the
first witness to the charter is Hervey de Stretton, who held two
knights' fees of Stafford in 1166,<a id="footnotetaglei59" name="footnotetaglei59"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelei59"><sup>59</sup></a>
and that another is Robert
Bagot, who held a quarter of a fee,<a id="footnotetaglei60" name="footnotetaglei60"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelei60"><sup>60</sup></a>
while Geoffrey Ridel himself then
held one, namely, Madeley.<a id="footnotetaglei61" name="footnotetaglei61"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelei61"><sup>61</sup></a>
But the enrolling scribe confused him
with his (maternal) grandfather and namesake (d. 1120), and thus
wrongly assigned this charter to the reign of Henry I, and threw
the whole descent into utter confusion. The right clue is found in a
charter of Robert 'de Toni' (<i>i.e.</i> de Stafford), 'conceding' Madeley
to Robert 'de Busa' (<i>alias</i> 'de Busci'), 'per servitium unius militis'.<a id="footnotetaglei62" name="footnotetaglei62"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelei62"><sup>62</sup></a>
This fee, therefore, must have come to the Bassets with the rest of the
Buci estates; and we thus learn that this must have been late in the
reign of Henry I, for the names of the witnesses to this charter prove
that it must be subsequent to 1122.<a id="footnotetaglei63" name="footnotetaglei63"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelei63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>

<p>As Robert de Buci was then in possession, it cannot have been,
here at least, till later that Basset succeeded him.</p>

<p>Among the points to be observed in the descent of the above
fiefs are Edward of Salisbury's succession to that of Ralf fitz
Hubert,<a id="footnotetaglei64" name="footnotetaglei64"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelei64"><sup>64</sup></a>
the appearance of Henry de Albini, founder of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg 174]</span>
Cainho line, as successor to Nigel, and the portions of the great
Belvoir fief, held in Domesday by Robert de Todeni, now owned by
Robert de L'Isle and William de Albini 'Brito'. In the midst of
great but vanished names, it is pleasant to meet with one, at least,
still surviving in the male line: William de Gresley, holder of
Linton (a Derbyshire hamlet close to Gresley), had succeeded,
there and at 'Widesers', Nigel, a tenant of Henry de Ferrers in
1086 (D.B., i. 233<i>b</i>).<a id="footnotetaglei65" name="footnotetaglei65"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotelei65"><sup>65</sup></a>
In this 'Nigel', therefore, it would seem, we
have Nigel de Stafford, Lord of Drakelow (D.B., i. 278).</p>

<p>I will close with the names of those who had succeeded the
Domesday tenants-in-chief.</p>

<h3>THE NORTHAMPTONSHIRE SURVEY</h3>

<p class="title1c">(<span class="sc">Hen. i-Hen. ii</span>)</p>

<p>This 'Hydarium' of Northamptonshire is found in a Peterborough
Cartulary (Cott. MS. Vesp. E. 22, fo. 94 <i>et seq.</i>). It is drawn up
Hundred by Hundred, like the surveys of Leicestershire and of
Lindsey, and is, therefore, probably connected with the assessment
of Danegeld. Although it is of special value for reconstituting the
Domesday Vills, the assessment it records so often varies from that
which is found in Domesday that we cannot institute a close comparison.
The introduction of a 'parva virgata' further complicates
the reckoning. That the original document was written on a roll is
shown by the use of the phrase 'per alium rotulum'. The statement
on fo. 97<i>b</i> that there ought, at one place, to be half a hide more
'per rotulos Wyncestr[ie]', would seem to refer to Domesday;
but on the next page we read:</p>

<blockquote><p>
In Pytesle Abbas de Burgo v. hid. [et] dim. set tamen in Rotulis Wyncestr[ie]
vi. hid. et iii. parvas virgatas.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Since Domesday records this holding as 'v. hid. et una virgata
terr&aelig;', the reference (if the text of the survey is right) must clearly
be to some other record preserved in the national treasury.</p>

<p>I append about a fifth of the Survey as a specimen of the whole.</p>

<p>The only writer, it would seem, who has used this important
survey is Bridges, who refers to it throughout in his <i>Northamptonshire</i>
as of the time of 'Henry II'. A good instance of the confusion caused
by this assumption is seen in the remarks of Bridges as to Barnack (ii.
491), where he is puzzled by our record, giving as its lord, not
Gervase Paynell, but Fulc Paynell (who was really his grandfather).
To refute his conclusion, it is sufficient to refer to the first name
entered&mdash;that of 'Albricus Camerarius'. This was no other than
Aubrey de Vere, a trusted minister of Henry I, who was made by
him Great Chamberlain in 1133, and who was slain in May
1141.<a id="footnotetagns8" name="footnotetagns8"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotens8"><sup>8</sup></a> His Northamptonshire estate descended to his younger
son, Robert, who, as 'Robertus filius Albrici Camerarii', made his
return as a Northamptonshire 'baron' in 1166.<a id="footnotetagns9" name="footnotetagns9"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotens9"><sup>9</sup></a> There can, therefore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg 179]</span>
be no confusion between Aubrey the Chamberlain (d. 1141) and
his eldest son and namesake. Yet if, from the occurrence of his name,
we pronounced the date of this survey to be 1133-41, we should be
in error. There are names belonging to an earlier, as to a later, date
than this.</p>

<p>Among the earliest are 'Ricardus filius Wydonis', the son and
successor of Guy de Raimbercurt, a great Domesday tenant-in-chief;
Walter fitz Winemar, whose father was both a tenant <i>in
capite</i> and under-tenant in Domesday; and Ralf fitz Oger, whose
name illustrates the value of these early surveys; for the entry proves
that Oger, the Northamptonshire tenant-in-chief (D.B., i. 228), was
identical with Oger 'Brito', the Lord of Bourne, Linc. (i. 364<i>b</i>),
and that the son and successor of this Oger was Ralf. We also
recognize Roger Marmion, who was succeeded, under Henry
I, by Robert; Nigel de Albini, the founder of the house of Mowbray;
Michael de Hanslape, who died under Henry I; and 'Robertus
filius Regis', who became Earl of Gloucester <i>circ.</i> 1122. Other tenants,
living <i>temp.</i> Hen. I, are William de Mandeville,<a id="footnotetagns10" name="footnotetagns10"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotens10"><sup>10</sup></a> William Meschin,
Richard Basset, Viel (Vitalis) Engaine, Baldwin fitz Gilbert, and
Brian fitz Count. As for Ascelin de Waterville and Alouf de Merke,
they are found as under-tenants in Domesday itself. On the other
hand, such a name as 'Comes Warenn de Morteyn' points to the
latter years of Stephen's reign, or to the early days of that of Henry
II; while the mention of the earldoms of Arundel, Ferrers (Derby)
and Essex preclude, of course, an earlier date than 1140.</p>

<p>After careful examination, I propound the solution that this
survey was originally made under Henry I, and was subsequently
corrected here and there, to bring the entries up to date, down to
the days of Henry II. The late transcriber, to whom we owe the
survey in its present form, has incorporated these additions and
corrections in a single text with the most bewildering result. We
trace exactly the same process in the Red Book of the Exchequer.
In the Black Book the later additions that were made to the barons'
<cite>cartae</cite> of 1166 are distinguished by the difference in handwriting. But
in the Red Book these interpolations are found transcribed in the
same hand as the genuine original returns. To the uninitiated this
has been the cause of no small confusion. So, too, in the above list of
Peterborough knights (p. 157), the very first entry, made <i>temp.</i>
Hen. I, has been carried on by a later hand to the time of Henry III.
But there Stapleton, who transcribed the list, carefully discriminated
between the two.<a id="footnotetagns11" name="footnotetagns11"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotens11"><sup>11</sup></a>
It is probable that the lists of Abingdon knights,
published in the Abingdon cartulary, are rendered untrustworthy
in places from the same cause of error.</p>

<p>The transcriber's ignorance is clearly shown by such a name as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg 180]</span>
'Comes Mauricius', which is evidently his erroneous extension of an
original 'Comes Maur'', <i>i.e.</i> Count of Mortain! So also we are enabled
to detect proof of the theory I advance in such an entry as
'Willelmus Meschin de feodo Wellelmi de Curcy'; for William de
Curcy held, <i>temp.</i> Henry II, the barony held by William Meschin
(his maternal grandfather, according to Stapleton<a id="footnotetagns12" name="footnotetagns12"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotens12"><sup>12</sup></a>)
<i>temp.</i> Henry I.
Thus, the original entry will have run 'William Meschin', while a
later hand, in his grandson's days, will have added, by way of substitution,
'De feodo William de Curcy'.<a id="footnotetagns13" name="footnotetagns13"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotens13"><sup>13</sup></a>
Our transcriber, combining the two, has, of course, made nonsense of the whole.
The same explanation applies to the entry, 'Robertus filius Regis de feodo
Glovernie', where the first three words represent the original entry,
while the others were added, probably under Henry II, to connect
the holding with the fief of [the Earl of] Gloucester. 'Brien filius
Comitis de feodo de Wallin[g]ford' is another instance in point, and
so, I suspect, is 'Odo [<i>sic</i>] dapifer de feodo de Colcestra'; for I take it
that the entry was originally made in the lifetime of Eudo Dapifer
(d. 1120) and that, as his 'honour' passed into the King's hands, the
'de feodo de Colcestra' was added at a later time.<a id="footnotetagns14" name="footnotetagns14"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotens14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>I have given sufficient of the survey to prove that, in spite of confusion
and corruption, it possesses a real value. If we take, for instance,
Polebrook ('Pochebroc'), a township of five hides, we find
that in Domesday (221<i>b</i>, 228) Eustace ('the Sheriff') held a hide and
a quarter <i>in capite</i> and three hides and three quarters as a tenant of
Peterborough Abbey (see p. <a href="#page138">138</a>). Now our survey shows us the
former holding in the hands of Robert de Cauz, while the other has
been broken up, two-thirds of it passing to Walter 'de Clopton' and
one-third to Roger Marmion.</p>

<p>Just below, in the case of Hemington, also a Vill of five hides,
which was equally divided between the Abbeys of Peterborough and
Ramsey, we read in Domesday that 'iii. milites' held the Peterborough
half (221<i>b</i>). Our survey enables us to distinguish their
tenancies&mdash;Richard fitz Gilbert holding a hide and three-eighths;
Guy Maufe, five-eighths of a hide, and Reginald le Moyne the
same.<a id="footnotetagns15" name="footnotetagns15"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotens15"><sup>15</sup></a> But we can go further and identify the first, from his holding,
as the son of Gilbert Fauvel, the Domesday tenant (see p. <a href="#page138">138</a>);
while the second was the heir, and probably the son of Roger
Malfed (see p. <a href="#page132">132</a>).</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg 181]</span></p>

<p>One more instance may be given. Our survey reckons Clapton
('Cloptone') as five and a quarter hides, of which 'Walter' held one
and a quarter <i>in capite</i>. Here again he had succeeded Eustace, whose
Domesday estate at 'Dotone' (228) ought, as Bridges conjectured, to
have been entered 'Clotone'.<a id="footnotetagns16" name="footnotetagns16"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotens16"><sup>16</sup></a> On the other hand, his tenancy of the
Abbot at 'Clotone' had been broken up, half a hide of it passing to
Ascelin de Waterville. All this goes to show that the fief of Eustace the
Sheriff did not, as has been alleged, descend to his heirs.</p>

<p>Such an entry as 'In Lilleford, Willelmus Olyfart v. hidas de
feudo Regis Scoti&aelig;' is peculiarly suggestive. It reminds us that David
Holyfard, godson of King David of Scotland, and his protector in
1141, was the founder of the house of Oliphant; and in the family's
possession of Lilford (which was held of the Countess Judith in
1086) we see the origin of their Scottish connection. William
'Olifard' was of Northamptonshire, and Hugh 'Olifard' of Huntingdonshire
in 1130;<a id="footnotetagns17" name="footnotetagns17"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotens17"><sup>17</sup></a> while Hugh 'Olifart' (of Stoke) was a knight of the
Abbot of Peterborough in rather earlier days. The earliest member
of the house, however, it would seem, on record is Roger Olifard,
who witnessed (doubtless as his tenant) Earl Simon's charter to St.
Andrew's, Northampton, granted, probably, not later than 1108.
This, of course, is but one of the cases in which the son of a Norman
house settled in Scotland through its King's connection with the
earldoms of Huntingdon and Northampton.</p>

<p>At the close of the survey I have here discussed there is a list of the
knights of Peterborough (fos. 99<i>b</i>, 100) holding in Northamptonshire.
It ought to be carefully compared with the one I have examined
above (p. 131), being, it seems probable, about a generation
later. Such entries as these, at least, are conclusive for the holding to
which they refer:</p>

<table class="diff1" summary="comparison" border="0">

<tr>
       <td class="w2">Paganus de Helpestun terciam
	   partem unius militis (<cite>Chronicon

	   terciam partem i. militis
	   (Vesp. E. xxii., fo. 100).
	   </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>In the same way, Roger Marmion had been succeeded by Robert.
This second list is of special value from the fact that the Peterborough
<cite>carta</cite> of 1166 gives no particulars of the knights or of their
fees.</p>

Since this was written I have come across a curious confirmation of the
hypothesis advanced. In the Lindsey Survey (Ed. Greenstreet), an entry on fo.
20, in the original ran: 'Comes Odo [tenet] in Aldobi', above which a later hand
has interlined, 'De feodo Comitis Albemerle'. It is curious that in the same survey
another later interlineation&mdash;'Comes Lincoln'&mdash;was, though distinguished by
Hearne, incorporated with the text by Mr Waters (see p. <a href="#page151">151</a>).</p>

It is singular that in Sussex the 'Cloninctune' of Domesday is, conversely, an
error for 'Doninctune'. The source of the error in both cases must have been the
likeness of 'cl' to 'd' in the original returns, on which these names cannot have
begun with a capital letter.</p>

<h3>THE INTRODUCTION OF KNIGHT SERVICE INTO ENGLAND<a id="footnotetagks1" name="footnotetagks1"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks1"><sup>1</sup></a></h3> <!-- ks -->

<blockquote><p>
'The growth of knighthood is a subject on which the greatest obscurity
prevails; and the most probable explanation of its existence in England, the
theory that it is a translation into Norman forms of the thegnage of the
Anglo-Saxon law, can only be stated as probable.'&mdash;<span class="sc">Stubbs</span>, <cite>Const. Hist.</cite>,
i. 260.
</p></blockquote>

<p>In approaching the consideration of the institutional changes and
modifications of polity resulting from the Norman Conquest, the
most conspicuous phenomenon to attract attention is undoubtedly
the introduction of what it is convenient to term the feudal system.
In the present paper I propose to discuss one branch only of that
process, namely, the introduction of that military tenure which Dr
Stubbs has termed 'the most prominent feature of historical feudalism'.</p>

<p>In accordance with the anticataclysmic tendencies of modern
thought, the most recent students of this obscure problem have
agreed to adopt the theory of gradual development and growth.
The old views on the subject are discredited as crude and unhistorical:<a id="footnotetagks2" name="footnotetagks2"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks2"><sup>2</sup></a>
they are replaced by confident enunciation of the theory
to which I have referred.<a id="footnotetagks3" name="footnotetagks3"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks3"><sup>3</sup></a> But when we examine the matter closely,
when we ask for details of the process by which the Anglo-Saxon
thegn developed into the Norman knight, we are met at once by the
frank confession that 'between the picture drawn in Domesday and
the state of affairs which the charter of Henry I was designed to
remedy, there is a difference which the short interval of time will not
account for'.<a id="footnotetagks4" name="footnotetagks4"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks4"><sup>4</sup></a> To meet this difficulty, to account for this flaw in the
unbroken continuity of the series, a <i>Deus ex machin&acirc;</i> has been found
in the person of Ranulf Flambard.</p>

<p>Now this solution of the difficulty will scarcely, I venture to think,
bear the test of investigation. It appears to have originated in Dr
Stubbs' suggestion that there must have been, between the days of
Henry I and of William I, 'some skilful organizing hand working
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg 183]</span>
with neither justice nor mercy'<a id="footnotetagks5" name="footnotetagks5"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks5"><sup>5</sup></a>&mdash;a suggestion subsequently amplified
into the statement that it is to Ranulf Flambard 'without doubt
that the systematic organization of the exactions' under William
Rufus 'is to be attributed',<a id="footnotetagks6" name="footnotetagks6"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks6"><sup>6</sup></a> and that by him 'the royal claims were
unrelentingly pressed', his policy being 'to tighten as much as
possible the hold which the feudal law gave to the king on all feudatories
temporal and spiritual'.<a id="footnotetagks7" name="footnotetagks7"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks7"><sup>7</sup></a> There is nothing here that can be
called in question, but there is also nothing, be it observed, to prove
that either 'feudal law' or 'military tenure' was introduced by
Ranulf Flambard. Indeed, with his usual caution and unfailing
sound judgment, our great historian is careful to admit that 'it is
not quite so clear' in the case of the lay as of the church fiefs 'that all
the evil customs owed their origin to the reign of William Rufus'.<a id="footnotetagks8" name="footnotetagks8"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks8"><sup>8</sup></a>
And, even if they did, they were, it must be remembered, distinctly
abuses&mdash;'evil customs', as Henry I himself terms them in his
charter&mdash;namely (in the matter we are considering), '<em>excessive</em>
exactions in the way of reliefs, marriages and wardships, debts to
the crown, and forfeiture. In the place,' we are told, 'of <em>unlimited</em>
demands on these heads, the charter promises, not indeed fixed
amercements, but a return to ancient equitable custom'.<a id="footnotetagks9" name="footnotetagks9"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks9"><sup>9</sup></a> All this
refers, it will be seen, to the abuse of an existing institution, not to the
introduction of a new one. The fact is that Ranulf's proceedings have
been assigned a quite exceptional and undue importance. Broadly
speaking, his actions fall under a law too often lost sight of, namely,
that when the crown was strong it pressed, through the official
bureaucracy, its claims to the uttermost; and when it found itself
weak, it renounced them so far as it was compelled. Take, for instance,
this very charter issued by Henry I, when he was 'playing to
the gallery', and seeking general support: what was the value of its
promises? They were broken, says Mr Freeman, to the Church;<a id="footnotetagks10" name="footnotetagks10"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks10"><sup>10</sup></a>
they were probably broken, says Dr Stubbs, to the knights;<a id="footnotetagks11" name="footnotetagks11"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks11"><sup>11</sup></a>
and they were certainly broken, I may add, to the unfortunate
tenants-in-chief, whom the Pipe-Roll of 1130 shows us suffering
from those same excessive exactions, of which the monopoly is
assigned to Ranulf Flambard, and which 'the Lion of Justice' had
so virtuously renounced. I might similarly adduce the exactions
from the Church by that excellent king, Henry II (1159), 'contra
antiquum morem et debitam libertatem'; but it is needless to
multiply examples of the struggle between the interests of the
crown and those of its tenants-in-chief, which was as fierce as ever
when, in later days, it led to the provisions of the Great Charter.
What the barons, lay and spiritual, complained of from first to last,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg 184]</span>
was not the feudal system that accompanied their military tenure,
but the abuse of that system in the excessive demands of the crown.</p>

<p>Mr Freeman, however, who had an equal horror of Ranulf
Flambard and of the 'feudal system', did not hesitate to connect
the two more closely even than Dr Stubbs, though invoking the
authority of the latter in support of his extreme views. The passages
to which I would invite attention, as expressing most concisely Mr
Freeman's conclusions, are these:</p>

<blockquote><p>
The system of military tenures, and the oppressive consequences which
were held to flow from them, were a work of the days of William Rufus.</p>

<p>If then there was any time when 'the Feudal System' could be said to be
introduced into England, it was assuredly not in the days of William the
Conqueror, but in the days of William the Red. It would be more accurate
to say that all that we are really concerned with, that is, not an imaginary
'Feudal System', but a system of feudal land-tenures, was not introduced
into England at all, but was devised on English ground by the malignant
genius of the minister of Rufus.<a id="footnotetagks12" name="footnotetagks12"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks12"><sup>12</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>As the writer's line of argument is avowedly that of Dr Stubbs,
it is only necessary to consider the point of difference between them.
Where his predecessor saw in Henry's charter the proof that Ranulf
Flambard had abused the existing feudal system by 'excessive' and
'unlimited' demands, Mr Freeman held, and endeavoured to
convince us, that he had introduced not merely abuses of the system,
but the actual system itself.<a id="footnotetagks13" name="footnotetagks13"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks13"><sup>13</sup></a> The question virtually turns on the
first clause of the charter;<a id="footnotetagks14" name="footnotetagks14"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks14"><sup>14</sup></a> and it will not, I think, be doubted
that Dr Stubbs is right in adopting its natural meaning, namely,
that the novelty introduced by Ranulf was not the <i>relevatio</i> itself, but
its abuse in 'excessive exactions'. Indeed, even Mr Freeman had
virtually to admit the point.<a id="footnotetagks15" name="footnotetagks15"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks15"><sup>15</sup></a> If, then, the argument breaks down, if
Ranulf cannot be shown to have 'devised' military tenure, how are
we to bridge over the alleged chasm between the date of Domesday
(1086) and that of Henry's charter (1100)? The answer is simply that
the difficulty is created by the very theory I am discussing: it is
based on the assumption that William I did not introduce military
tenure,<a id="footnotetagks16" name="footnotetagks16"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks16"><sup>16</sup></a> combined with the fact that 'within thirteen years after the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg 185]</span>
Conqueror's death, not only the military tenures, but the worst
abuses of the military tenures, were in full force in England'.<a id="footnotetagks17" name="footnotetagks17"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks17"><sup>17</sup></a>
But, here again, when we examine the evidence, we find that this
assumption is based on the silence, or alleged silence, of Domesday
Book.<a id="footnotetagks18" name="footnotetagks18"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks18"><sup>18</sup></a> Now no one was better aware than Mr Freeman, as an
ardent student of 'the great Record', that to argue from the silence
of Domesday is an error as dangerous as it is common. Speaking
from a rather wide acquaintance with topographical works, I
know of no pitfall into which the local antiquary is more liable to fall.
Wonderful are the things that people look for in the pages of the
great survey; I am always reminded of Mr Secretary Pepys' writing
for information as to what it contained 'concerning the sea and the
dominion thereof'.<a id="footnotetagks19" name="footnotetagks19"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks19"><sup>19</sup></a> Like other inquests, the Domesday Survey&mdash;'the
great inquest of all', as Dr Stubbs terms it&mdash;was intended for a
special purpose; special questions were asked, and these questions
were answered in the returns. So with the 'Inquest of Sheriffs' in
1170; so also with the Inquest of Knights, if I may so term it, in
1166. In each case the questions asked are, practically, known to us,
and in each they are entirely different. Therefore, when Mr Freeman
writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>
The survey nowhere employs the feudal language which became familiar
in the twelfth century. Compare, for instance, the records in the first volume
of Hearn's <cite>Liber Niger Scaccarii</cite>. In this last we find something about knights'
fees in every page. In Domesday there is not a word&mdash;<a id="footnotetagks20" name="footnotetagks20"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks20"><sup>20</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>it is in no spirit of captious criticism, but from the necessity of
demolishing the argument, that I liken it to basing conclusions on
the fact that in the census returns we find something about population
in every page, while in the returns of owners of land there is not a
word. As the inquest of 1166 sought solely for information on knights
and their fees, the returns to it naturally contain 'something about
knights' fees in every page'; on the other hand, 'the payment or nonpayment
of the <i>geld</i> is a matter which appears in every page of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg 186]</span>
survey' [of 1086] because 'the formal immediate cause of taking the
survey was to secure its full and fair assessment'.<a id="footnotetagks21" name="footnotetagks21"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks21"><sup>21</sup></a> Nor is this all.
When the writer asserts that 'in Domesday there is not a word'
about knights' fees, he greatly overstates his case, as indeed is
shown by the passages he proceeds to quote. I shall be able to
prove, further on, that knights' fees existed in cases where Domesday
does not mention them, but even the incidental notices found in the
Great Survey are quite sufficient to disprove its alleged silence on
the subject. As Mr Freeman has well observed:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Its most incidental notices are sometimes the most precious. We have seen
that it is to an incidental, an almost accidental notice in the Survey that we
owe our knowledge of the great fact of the general redemption of lands.<a id="footnotetagks22" name="footnotetagks22"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks22"><sup>22</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Here then the writer does not hesitate to base on a single accidental
notice the existence of an event quite as widespread and important
as the introduction of knight service.<a id="footnotetagks23" name="footnotetagks23"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<p>I have now endeavoured to make plain one of the chief flaws in
the view at present accepted, namely, that it is mainly grounded on
the negative evidence of Domesday, which evidence will not bear the
construction that has been placed upon it&mdash;and further that, even if
it did, we should be landed in a fresh difficulty, the gulf between
Domesday and Henry's charter being only to be bridged by the
assumption that Ranulf Flambard 'devised' and introduced military
tenure, with its results&mdash;an assumption, we have seen, which the
facts of the case not only fail to support, but even discountenance
wholly.</p>

<p>Let us pass to a second difficulty. When we ask the advocates of
the view I am discussing what determined the number of knights
due to the crown from a tenant-in-chief, we obtain, I venture to
assert, no definite answer. At times we are told that it was the
number of his hides; at times that it was the value of his estate.
Gneist, who has discussed the matter in detail, and on several
occasions, has held throughout, broadly speaking, the same view:
he maintains that 'since Alfred's time the general rule had been
observed that a fully equipped man should be furnished for every
five <i>hid&aelig;</i>, but it had never been established as a rule of law as in the
Carlovingian legislation':<a id="footnotetagks24" name="footnotetagks24"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks24"><sup>24</sup></a>
consequently, he urges, 'a fixed standard
for the apportionment of the soldiery was wanting' at the time of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg 187]</span>
Conquest, and this want was a serious flaw in the Anglo-Saxon
polity. William resolved to make the system uniform, and</p>

<blockquote><p>
the object that the royal administration now pursued for a century was to
impose upon the whole mass of old and new possessors an equal obligation
to do service for reward. The standard adopted in carrying out this system
was approximately that of the five hides possession of the Anglo-Saxon
period; yet with a stricter rating according to the value of the produce.<a id="footnotetagks25" name="footnotetagks25"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks25"><sup>25</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>The difficulty encountered in ascertaining this value was a main
cause of the Domesday Survey being undertaken. This is Gneist's
special point on which he invariably insists: 'Domesday book laid the
basis of a roll of the crown vassals';<a id="footnotetagks26" name="footnotetagks26"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks26"><sup>26</sup></a>
upon it, 'in later times, the
fee-rolls were framed'.<a id="footnotetagks27" name="footnotetagks27"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks27"><sup>27</sup></a>
By its evidence, 'according to the extent
and the nature of the productive property, could be computed how
many shields were to be furnished by each estate, according to the
gradually fixed proportion of a &pound;20 ground rent'.<a id="footnotetagks28" name="footnotetagks28"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks28"><sup>28</sup></a>
For 'the <i>feuda
militum</i> thus computed are no knights' fees of a limited area',<a id="footnotetagks29" name="footnotetagks29"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks29"><sup>29</sup></a>
but 'units of possession', the unit being &pound;20 in annual value.</p>

<p>Dr Stubbs, on the other hand, while rejecting the view that
military service, since the days of Alfred, had been practically
fixed at one warrior for every five hides,<a id="footnotetagks30" name="footnotetagks30"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks30"><sup>30</sup></a> leans nevertheless to the
belief that the knight's fee was developed out of the five-hide unit,
and that the military 'service' of a tenant-in-chief was determined by
the number of such units which he possessed. But, as he also recognizes
the &pound;20 unit, there will be less danger of misrepresenting his
views if I append <i>verbatim</i> the relevant passages:</p>

       duty ... and the number of knights

<p>Mr Freeman's views need not detain us, for he unhesitatingly
accepts Dr Stubbs' arguments as proving that the Norman military
tenure was based on 'the old service of a man from each five hides of
land'.<a id="footnotetagks37" name="footnotetagks37"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p>We find then, I submit, that the recognized leaders of existing
opinion on the subject cannot agree among themselves in giving us a
clear answer, when we ask them what determined the amount of
'service' due from a Norman tenant-in-chief, or, in other words,
how that 'service' was developed in unbroken continuity from Anglo-Saxon
obligations.</p>

<p>The third point that I would raise is this. Even assuming that the
amount of 'service' bore a fixed proportion&mdash;whether in pecuniary or
territorial units&mdash;to the extent of possession, we are, surely, at once
confronted by the difficulty that the owner of <i>x</i> units of possession
would be compelled, for the discharge of his military obligations, to
enfeoff <i>x</i> knights, assigning a 'unit' to each. A tenant-in-chief, to
take a concrete instance, whose fief was worth &pound;100 a year, would
have to provide <i>ex hypothesi</i> five knights; if, as was quite usual, he
enfeoffed the full number, he would have to assign to each knight
twenty librates of land (which I may at once, though anticipating,
admit was the normal value of a knight's fee), that is to say, the
crown would have forestalled Henry George, and the luckless <i>baro</i>
would see the entire value of his estate swallowed up in the discharge
of its obligations.<a id="footnotetagks38" name="footnotetagks38"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks38"><sup>38</sup></a> What his position would be in cases where,
as often, he enfeoffed more knights than he required, arithmetic is
unable to determine. I cannot understand how this obvious difficulty
has been so strangely overlooked.</p>

<p>The fourth and last criticism which I propose to offer on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg 189]</span>
subject is this. If we find that under Henry II&mdash;when we meet with
definite information&mdash;a fief contained, as we might expect, more
'units of possession' than it was bound to furnish knights (thus
leaving a balance over for the <i>baro</i> after sub-infeudation), we must
draw one of two conclusions: either this excess had existed from the
first; or, if the fief (as we are asked to believe) was originally assessed
up to the hilt for military service, that assessment must, in the
interval, have been reduced. In other words, Henry I&mdash;if, as Dr
Stubbs in one place suggests,<a id="footnotetagks39" name="footnotetagks39"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks39"><sup>39</sup></a> he was the first to take a 'regular
account of the knights' fees'&mdash;must have found the land with a
settled liability of providing one knight for every five hides, and
must, yet, have reduced that liability of his own accord, on the most
sweeping scale, thus, contrary to all his principles, ultroneously
deprived himself of the 'service' he was entitled to claim.</p>

<p>Having completed my criticisms of the accepted view, and set
forth its chief difficulties, I shall now propound the theory to which
my own researches have led me, following the same method of
proof as that adopted by Mr Seebohm in his <cite>English Village Community</cite>,
namely working back from the known to the relatively unknown,
till the light thrown upwards by the records of the twelfth
century illumines the language of Domesday and renders the allusions
of monks and chroniclers pregnant with meaning.</p>

<h4>1. THE 'CARTAE' OF 1166<a name="page189a" id="page189a"></a></h4>

<p>In the formal returns (<cite>cartae</cite>) made to the exchequer in 1166 by the
tenants-in-chief (<i>barones</i>) of England, of which the official transcripts
are preserved in the <cite>Liber Niger</cite> and the <cite>Liber Rubeus</cite>, we have
our earliest glimpse of the organization of that purely feudal host
among whom our lands had been parcelled out to be held, as I
shall show, by military service. We have, therefore, in them our
best starting-point for an inquiry into the origin and growth of
military tenure in England.</p>

<p>It may be well perhaps, at the very outset, to contrast these
<cite>cartae</cite> of 1166 with those of the Domesday Inquest eighty years
before.<a id="footnotetagks40" name="footnotetagks40"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks40"><sup>40</sup></a> For the essentially feudal character of the former is at
once, by the comparison, thrown into relief. The original returns of
the Domesday Inquest were made Hundred by Hundred; those of
1166 were made fief by fief. The former were made by the jurors of
the Hundred-court; the latter by the lord of the fief. Thus, while the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg 190]</span>
one took for its unit the oldest and most familiar of native organizations,
the other, ignoring not only the Hundred, but even the shire
itself, took for its unit the alien organization of the fief.<a id="footnotetagks41" name="footnotetagks41"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks41"><sup>41</sup></a>
The one inquest strictly continued, the other wholly repudiated, the Anglo-Saxon
system.</p>

<p>It is consequently worse than lost labour to examine these two
inquests, based as they are on opposite systems, and giving us as
they do a cross-division as if they were but successive editions of the
national register or rate-book.</p>

<p>The first point to be considered is this: What was the information
which the tenants-in-chief were called upon to supply in these returns?
It was <em>not</em>, as Dr Stubbs and others have supposed, the amount of
'service' due from each fief to the crown.<a id="footnotetagks42" name="footnotetagks42"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks42"><sup>42</sup></a>
The information asked for was <em>the number of 'milites' actually enfeoffed</em> by each 'baron' and his
predecessors in title, with the number of 'servitia' due from each
such 'miles' to the 'baron'. In this distinction, missed by Dr Stubbs,
we find the key to the problem. The crown, we shall see, must
previously have known the total amount of 'service' due from each
fief; but what it did not know, and what it wished to know, was the
number of knights' fees which, up to 1166, had been created on each
fief.</p>

<p>Although there is great diversity in the form of return adopted&mdash;a
diversity which imparts to the <cite>cartae</cite> a pleasant flavour of character&mdash;it
may fairly be assumed that, as in similar cases, they were called
for throughout the realm by one uniform writ. If we may deduce the
purport of that writ from the collation of those returns which refer
to it most explicitly, we must infer that the information asked for
was to be given under four heads:</p>

<blockquote><p>
(1)  How many knights had been enfeoffed before the death of
Henry I?</p>

<p>(2)  How many have been enfeoffed since?</p>

<p>(3)  How many (if any) remain to be enfeoffed to complete the
'service' due from the fief. Or, in other words, what is the balance
of your 'service' remaining chargeable to your 'demesne'?</p>

<p>(4)  What are the names of your knights?</p></blockquote>

<p>In support of these statements I append the whole of the relevant
returns.

<p>Let me here break off for a moment to consider one of the most
important points suggested by this great inquest, namely, the issue
of the writs under which it was held. It has been generally assumed
that each tenant received his writ direct from the crown; and a
casual reading of the <cite>cartae</cite> might, perhaps, favour such a view. I
have, however, been led to the conclusion that a general writ was
issued to the sheriff of each county, and that its terms were communicated
by him to the several tenants-in-chief, whose <i>capita baroni&aelig;</i>
lay within his jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Baderun of Monmouth has heard the writ read out in the county
court;<a id="footnotetagks45" name="footnotetagks45"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks45"><sup>45</sup></a>
Earl Patrick also has heard the writ read out.<a id="footnotetagks46" name="footnotetagks46"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks46"><sup>46</sup></a>
William fitz Siward derives from the sheriff, he tells us, his knowledge of the
writ:<a id="footnotetagks47" name="footnotetagks47"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks47"><sup>47</sup></a>
even the bishop of Chester has received his instructions from
the sheriff.<a id="footnotetagks48" name="footnotetagks48"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks48"><sup>48</sup></a>
But more especially do I rely upon the return of the
Archbishop of York because he recites the tenor of the writ in terms
which can leave no doubt that it was addressed, through the sheriff,
to the whole shire collectively.<a id="footnotetagks49" name="footnotetagks49"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks49"><sup>49</sup></a>
If the Archbishop of York did not
receive a special writ, we may fairly infer that no other tenant can
have done so.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg 193]</span></p>

<p>Further, I believe that as the 'barons' received their instructions
from the sheriffs, so they also sent in their returns through those
officers. The memorandum, for instance, on the missing <cite>carta</cite> of
Osbert fitz Hugh informs us that it was brought to the exchequer
by William de Beauchamp. Now, William de Beauchamp was
sheriff of the shire. This would account for the grouping of the returns
'per singulos comitatus', as Swereford expresses it, and indeed this
arrangement would but follow the existing practice of collecting
the scutage shire by shire.</p>

<p>Returning now to the terms of the inquiry, it is obvious that the
tenant (<i>baro</i>) to whom such queries were addressed must of necessity
have belonged to one of these three classes&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
(<i>a</i>) Those who had created <em>the exact number</em> of knights' fees sufficient
to discharge their 'service'.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Those who had created <em>more</em> than sufficient.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Those who had created <em>less</em> than sufficient.
</p></blockquote>

<p>This last class requires some explanation. When the number of
knights' fees created was not sufficient to discharge the baron's
'service', the balance of that service remained charged on the non-infeudated
portion of his fief, that is, on the 'demesne', and was technically
said to be 'super dominium'. It is all-important that this
should be grasped, for it might otherwise be supposed that such a
phrase as 'quot milites super dominium' implied the existence of
actual knights enfeoffed on the demesne, which, to those who
realize the working of the system of knight-service, is an absolute
contradiction in terms. This, it will be found, beautifully explains
the first article of the Assize of Arms (1181)&mdash;that every tenant is to
keep in stock harness for as many knights 'quot habuerit feoda
militum in dominio suo'.<a id="footnotetagks50" name="footnotetagks50"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks50"><sup>50</sup></a>
That is to say, that if, after deducting the
knights actually enfeoffed, there remained due from his fief a
balance of knight-service, he must keep in readiness harness sufficient
for those knights whom he would have to provide himself to discharge
that balance.<a id="footnotetagks51" name="footnotetagks51"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>

<p>Having made this point clear, I now pass to the immediate
object of the inquest of 1166. What that object was, no one has as
yet discovered. Dr Stubbs, for instance, in his preface to the Pipe-Roll
of 1166, writes: 'On the immediate purpose for which the
inquiry was made&mdash;and it can scarcely be doubted that it was for the
collection of a scutage&mdash;we shall look for further information in the
rolls of the succeeding years.' My own researches enable me to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[pg 194]</span>
assert that this inquest formed part of a financial revolution hitherto
ignored, which deserves to be compared with those other innovations
in administration and finance that characterized the
latter half of the twelfth century in England.</p>

<p>When we come to place side by side the returns of 1166 and the
payments made upon those returns in 1168, we find (at least, on the
lay fiefs) the same distinction in both between 'the old feoffment' and
'the new'. But while the <em>returns</em>, as we saw, were made under three
heads,<a id="footnotetagks52" name="footnotetagks52"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks52"><sup>52</sup></a>
the <em>payments</em> were made under two, namely, under the two
feoffments. The reason of this difference can be established beyond
dispute: the exchequer clerks had, in every instance, added the
returns under the <em>third</em> head to those under the <em>first</em>, and classed
them together as 'old feoffment'. This is one of the points which, I
think, have never been hitherto explained.</p>

<p>Plenty of examples might be given, but these two will suffice.
Walter de Aincurt returns 24 fees <i>de veteri</i>, 5 <i>de novo</i>, and 11 <i>super
dominium</i>. The exchequer, in 1168, records him as paying on 35 fees
<i>de veteri</i>, and on 5 <i>de novo</i>.<a id="footnotetagks53" name="footnotetagks53"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks53"><sup>53</sup></a>
Richard de Haie returns 11 fees <i>de veteri</i>,
4 <i>de novo</i>, and 5 <i>super dominium</i>. The exchequer records him as paying
on 16 <i>de veteri</i>, and 4 <i>de novo</i>.</p>

<p>The main point, however, on which I propose to insist, is that
these returns were intended to provide, and, as a matter of fact, did
provide a new feudal assessment, wholly superseding the old one,
in no case to the advantage of the tenant, but in many to the advantage
of the crown. The <i>modus operandi</i> was as follows. Instead of
either adhering to the old assessment (<cite>servitium debitum</cite>), or uniformly
substituting a new one based on the fees actually created, the
crown selected in every case whichever of these two systems told in
its own favour and against the tenant of the fief. If he had enfeoffed
fewer knights than his <cite>servitium debitum</cite> required, the crown
retained that <cite>servitium</cite> as the irreducible minimum of his assessment;
but if he had created an excess of fees, the crown added that excess to
his pre-existing assessment and increased the 'service' due from him
<i>pro tanto</i>. This discovery is no conjecture, but is capable of arithmetical
demonstration.</p>

<p>It should be noticed how skilfully the queries were framed in the
inquest of 1166, to entrap the unwary tenant, and make him commit
himself to the facts. If his enfeoffed knights were short of the required
number, he was caught under the third query; if, on the
other hand, he had an excess, he was caught under the others. Now,
did the 'barons', when they made their returns, anticipate this
sweeping and unwelcome reform? Presumably not. They appear to
have drawn up their <cite>cartae</cite> carefully and willingly, few of those who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[pg 195]</span>
had an excess of knights taking even the precaution of mentioning
their <cite>servitium debitum</cite>.<a id="footnotetagks54" name="footnotetagks54"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks54"><sup>54</sup></a> The church, moreover, from the terms in
which her payments are thenceforth entered (<cite>vide infra</cite>), must have
uniformly and systematically adopted an attitude of protest. Yet
there is no trace of such protest in her returns. May we then infer
that the crown sought to deliberately entrap its tenants? Two
circumstances might favour that view. In the first place the tenants
had to make their returns <i>extra sigillum pendentes</i>, thereby solemnly
committing themselves;<a id="footnotetagks55" name="footnotetagks55"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks55"><sup>55</sup></a> in the second, the tenants would, of course,
have been tempted to conceal or understate their excess of knights,
had they foreseen the use that the crown would make of their
returns.</p>

<p>The question may very fairly be asked, 'What check had the
crown upon a tenant in the event of the latter omitting some of his
"excess" fees?' The answer is supplied, I think, by a clause in the
invaluable return of the northern primate. He there requests that
his return may be accepted 'without prejudice', as a lawyer would
say, in case of his omitting some small fees. That is to say, these
formal returns might be brought up as evidence against tenants-in-chief
who had omitted some of their fees, proving that they had
thereby themselves disowned their right to the fees in question.<a id="footnotetagks56" name="footnotetagks56"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>

<p>Two points strike one strongly in the preparation of these returns.
The first of these is the difficulty experienced in compiling a correct
list of under-tenants and their holdings; the second is the employment
of the 'Inquest' as a means of ascertaining the particulars.</p>

<p>Taking the former of these, we find Hugh Wac writing, 'si amplius
inquirere possim, notificabo vobis'; and Guarine 'de Aula', 'si
plus possim inquirere, faciam vobis scire'; so too the Bishop of Ely,
'de hiis vero certi sumus, et si amplius inquirere poterimus libenter
vobis significabimus'; and the Bishop of Bath, 'si certiorem inquirere
poterimus veritatem, nos illam vobis significabimus'; and Alfred of
Lincoln, 'si plus inquiri potest, inquirere faciemus'. The Bishop of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[pg 196]</span>
Exeter makes his return, 'sicut eam diligentius inquirere potui'; the
Abbot of Tavistock, 'quantum inde sollicitius inquirendo scire
potuit'. Hugh de Lacy, in a postscript to his return, adds a fee 'quod
oblitus sum'; while the Earl of Clare has to send in a subsequent
rider, containing an entry, 'quod ego postquam misi cartam ... recordatus
sum'.</p>

<p>From this difficulty it is a short step to the inquests which it
seems in some cases to have necessitated. The Abbot of Ramsey
heads his return, 'Haec est inquisitio'; the Earl of Warwick similarly
commences, 'Hoc est quod inquisivi per homines'. Earl Patrick
makes his return, 'secundum quod de probis et antiquis hominibus
meis inquirere potui'. 'Fecimus inquirere,' writes the Bishop of
Bath, 'per legales homines meos.... Haec autem per eos inquisivimus.'</p>

<p>This brings us directly to the very important inquest referred to
in the <cite>carta</cite> of the Earl of Arundel:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Dominus noster Rex Henricus quadam contentione quae surrexit inter
milites de honore de Arundel de exercitu quodam de Walliis, elegit iiij.
milites de honore, de melioribus et legalioribus, et antiquioribus ... et fecit
eos recognoscere servitia militum de honore, et super legalitatem et sacramenta
eorum inde neminem audire voluit.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr Eyton argued elaborately on genealogical grounds that this
inquest must have taken place under Henry I, but indeed it is
quite obvious from the language of the <cite>carta</cite> itself that this was so.
It is, consequently, worthy of notice for its bearing on 'the sworn
inquest'. While on this subject, attention may be called to the unique
entry in the Pipe-Roll of 12 Henry II (1166): 'Alanus de Munbi
debet xl. s. quia non interfuit Jurat' feodorum militum' (p. 8).
Investigation proves (through what is known as the Lindsey Survey)
that Alan was an under-tenant of the honour of Brittany, the
successor of that Eudo who held in Mumby <i>temp.</i> Domesday. This
fact throws light on the entry, by suggesting that the inquest
referred to concerned the honour of Brittany, the number of fees in
which was then and subsequently doubtful.</p>

<p>But to return. It is infinitely easier to trace the change brought
about by the inquest of 1166 in the case of the church fiefs than
of the lay ones. For on the former it was uniform and glaring.
Previously to 1166 the church tenants had paid on their <i>servitium
debitum</i> alone; after 1166 they paid, as a rule, on all the fees actually
created upon the fief. Thus the assessment of the Bishop of Durham
was raised at a blow from ten fees to more than seventy.<a id="footnotetagks57" name="footnotetagks57"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks57"><sup>57</sup></a>
There were<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg 197]</span>
several equally striking cases among the prelates. Now, whether or
not the church tenants feared something of the kind, they had
generally been careful in their returns to set forth their <i>servitium
debitum</i>, and when, in 1168, they were uniformly assessed on their
total of fees, their uniform protest is expressed in the formula 'quos
non recognoscit' applied to the payment on their excess knights.
Such is the meaning of this puzzling formula which is peculiar to
the church fiefs.<a id="footnotetagks58" name="footnotetagks58"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks58"><sup>58</sup></a>
In these cases it wholly replaces the <i>de veteri</i> and <i>de
novo</i> assessment which, from 1166, was applied to the lay fiefs.</p>

<h4>II. THE SERVITIUM DEBITUM<a name="page197a" id="page197a"></a></h4>

<p>The essential feature we have to keep in view when examining the
growth of knight service is the <cite>servitium debitum</cite>, or quota of knight
service due to the crown from each fief.</p>

<p>This has, I venture to think, been obscured and lost sight of in the
generalizations and vague writing about the 'gradual process' of
development. It is difficult for me to traverse the arguments of
Gneist, Stubbs and Freeman, because we consider the subject from
such wholly different standpoints. For them the introduction of
knight service means the process of sub-infeudation on the several
fiefs; for me it means the grant of fiefs to be held from the crown by
knight service. Thus the process which absorbs the attention of the
school whose views I am opposing is for me a matter of mere secondary
importance. The whole question turns upon the point whether
or not the tenants-in-chief received their fiefs to hold of the crown by
a quota of military service, or not. If they did, it would depend
simply on their individual inclinations, whether, or how far, they
had recourse to sub-infeudation. It was not a matter of principle at
all; it was, as Dr Stubbs himself put it, 'a matter of convenience',<a id="footnotetagks59" name="footnotetagks59"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks59"><sup>59</sup></a>
a mere detail. What we have to consider is not the relation between
the tenant-in-chief and his under-tenants, but that between the
king and his tenants-in-chief: for this was the primary relation that
determined all below it.</p>

<p>The assumption that the Conqueror cannot have introduced any
new principle in the tenure of land lies at the root of the matter.
Assuming this, one must of course seek elsewhere for the introduction
of knight service. Have not the difficulties of the accepted view
arisen from its exponents approaching the problem from the wrong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg 198]</span>
point of view? The tendency to exalt the English and depreciate
the Norman element in our constitutional development has led
them I think, and especially Mr Freeman, to seek in Anglo-Saxon
institutions an explanation of feudal phenomena. This tendency is
manifest in their conclusions on the great council:<a id="footnotetagks60" name="footnotetagks60"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks60"><sup>60</sup></a> it colours no
less strongly their views on knight service. In neither case can they
bring themselves to adopt the feudal standpoint or to enter into the
feudal spirit. It is to this that I attribute their disposition to bring the
crown face to face with the under-tenant&mdash;or 'landowner' as they
would prefer to term him&mdash;and so to ignore, or at least to minimize
the importance of the tenant-in-chief, the 'middleman' of the
feudal system. Making every allowance for the policy of the Conqueror
in insisting on the direct allegiance of the under-tenant to the
crown, and thereby checking the disintegrating influence of a
perfect feudal system, the fact remains what we may term the
'military service' bargain was a bargain between the crown and the
tenant-in-chief, not between the crown and his under-tenants.
It follows from this that so long as the 'baron' (or 'tenant-in-chief')
discharged his <cite>servitium debitum</cite> to the crown, the king had no right to
look beyond the 'baron', who was himself and alone responsible for
the discharge of this service. It is, indeed, in this responsibility that
lies the key to the situation. If the under-tenant of a knight's fee
failed to discharge his service, it was not to him, but to his lord, that
the crown betook itself. 'I know nothing of your tenant,' was in
effect the king's position; 'you owe me, for the tenure of your fief, the
service of so many knights, and that service must be performed,
whether your under-tenants repudiate their obligations to yourself
or not'. In other words the 'baron' discharged his service to the
king, whereas the baron's under-tenants discharged theirs to their
lord.<a id="footnotetagks61" name="footnotetagks61"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks61"><sup>61</sup></a> So the <cite>Dialogus</cite> speaks of the under-tenant's 'numerum
militum quos domino debuerat'.</p>

<p>Let us then apply ourselves directly to the quotas of military
service due from the 'barons' to the crown, and see if, when ascertained,
they throw any fresh light on the real problem.</p>

<p>No attempt, so far as I know, has ever been made to determine
these quotas, and indeed it was the utter want of trustworthy information
on the subject that led Swereford to undertake his researches
in the thirteenth century. Those researches, unfortunately, leave us
no wiser, partly from his defective method and want of the requisite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[pg 199]</span>
accuracy; partly from the fact that what he sought was not abstract
historical truth, but practical information bearing on the existing
rights of the crown. We must turn therefore to the original authorities:
(1) the <cite>cartae baronum</cite>, (2) the annual rolls. These were the two
main sources of Swereford's information, as they must also be of
ours. In the next part of this paper I shall deal with the evidence of
the rolls, as checking and supplementing the <cite>cartae baronum</cite>.</p>

<p>I shall analyse the church fiefs first, because we can ascertain,
virtually with exactitude, the <cite>servitium debitum</cite> of every prelate and of
every head of a religious house who held by knight service. The
importance of these figures, together with the fact that they have
never, so far as I know, been set forth till now, has induced me to
append them here in full detail.</p>

<p>Every English See then in existence is thus accounted for with the
solitary and significant exceptions of Carlisle and Rochester. The

<p>In the above list the figures in brackets refer to the assessments
previous to 1166. Three changes were made at, or about, that date.
The Bishop of Worcester, in accordance with the protest he had
made from the beginning of the reign, obtained a reduction of his
quota from sixty knights to fifty; while the Archbishop of York's
<cite>servitium</cite> was raised from seven knights to twenty, and that of the
Bishop of Chichester from two knights to four. These changes are
known to us only from the details of the prelate's scutages; there is
nothing to account for them in the relevant <cite>cartae</cite>, and we can only
infer from the formula <cite>quos recognoscit</cite> that the two bishops whose
<cite>servitia</cite> were increased acquiesced in the justice of the crown's claim.</p>

<p>The changes of assessment on religious houses were few, and are
thus accounted for. Glastonbury, which paid on sixty knights in the
first two scutages of the reign, paid on forty in the third and in those
which followed. Pershore paid on three in the first scutage, protesting
that it was only liable to two, and from 1168 it was only rated at two.
Shaftesbury, which had paid on ten knights in the first scutage, was
assessed at only seven in the third scutage and those which followed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[pg 201]</span>
Cerne also succeeded in getting its assessment reduced from three
knights to two. With these changes should be compared the letter of
Bishop Nigel of Ely to Ramsey Abbey certifying that it was only
liable to an assessment of four knights. Two cases remain which
require special treatment&mdash;Tavistock and Westminster.</p>

<p>Although Tavistock, in the first scutage, appears to have paid on
the anomalous assessment of ten and a half knights its payment on
fifteen in the two succeeding ones may fairly be taken as evidence
that this was its <cite>servitium debitum</cite>.<a id="footnotetagks65" name="footnotetagks65"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks65"><sup>65</sup></a> Its abbot, however, made no
reference to that <cite>servitium</cite> in his return, and&mdash;by an exception to the
regular practice in the case of church fiefs&mdash;we find him charged,
not on the fees, (1) 'quos recognoscit', (2) 'quos non recognoscit',
but on those which were enfeoffed 'de veteri', and 'de novo' just as
if he were a lay tenant. As his fees 'de veteri' were sixteen, this
figure recurs in successive scutages, until in 3 John we find him
contesting as to one knight ('unde est contentio') who, doubtless,
represented the difference between fifteen and sixteen.</p>

<p>The case of Westminster presents considerable difficulty, the
entries relating to its payments of scutage being very puzzling.
The abbey's fees lay chiefly in Worcestershire and Gloucestershire&mdash;especially
Worcestershire&mdash;and it is under this county that we find
it ultimately (<i>i.e.</i> from 1168 onwards) assessed at fifteen fees, an
assessment which the abbot himself seems to have claimed, in the
first scutage, as the right one.</p>

<p>Taking then the <cite>servitium debitum</cite> of all the church fiefs, at their
earliest ascertainable assessment, we obtain this result:</p>

<p>Graeland de Thani of Essex owed seven and a half knights (the
half of fifteen), and Roger de Berkeley probably the same. Those who
owed a <cite>servitium</cite> of five knights were Robert fitz Harding, Baldwin
Buelot, Simon de Cancy, Nigel de Lovetot (of the honour of
Tickhill), Amfry de Cancy, Hugh de Dover (of the honour of
Brunne),<a id="footnotetagks92" name="footnotetagks92"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks92"><sup>92</sup></a> Walter de Bolebec (Northumberland), Robert de Brus,
Roger Bertram, and probably Stephen de Bulmer,<a id="footnotetagks93" name="footnotetagks93"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks93"><sup>93</sup></a> and Herbert
'de Castello'.</p>

<p>The cases in which the <cite>servitium</cite> can be shown not to have been a
multiple of five are comparatively few. That of Simon de Beauchamp
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg 205]</span>
of Bedford was 54, of William Fossard 33&frac12;, of Humphrey de Bohun
30&frac12;, of William Malet 20&#8537;, of Robert de Beauchamp (of Somerset)
17, of William fitz John (of Harptree) 13&frac34;, of William Blund 12, of
Hugh Wac 10&#8539;, of William de Ros, William fitz John (of Weston)
and William de Beauchamp (of Worcestershire) 7, of John de
Bidun and Jocelin de Lovaine 5&frac12;.<a id="footnotetagks94" name="footnotetagks94"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks94"><sup>94</sup></a> But these, it will be seen, are
quite insufficient to overthrow the accumulated array of evidence
on the other side, and some of them are, doubtless, capable of
explanation. The Bohun fief, for instance, in 1162 paid on exactly
30 fees.</p>

<p>It is impossible to resist the inference, from such evidence as we
have, that the amount of the <cite>servitium debitum</cite> was a matter of
custom and tradition, and could not usually be determined by
reference to written grants or charters. On this point the returns of
three Essex tenants are most instructive, while their similarity is so
striking, that, as in the case of the Shropshire <cite>formul&aelig;</cite>, it can scarcely
be due to accident. The Earl of Essex closes with the words: 'et
homines mei dicunt mihi quod debeo Domino Regi lx. milites'.
Walter fitz Robert, who follows him, writes: 'et hoc mihi homines
mei intelligere faciunt, quod debeo inde Regi servitium de l.
militibus'. William de Montfichet ends thus: 'et hoc faciunt homines
mei mihi intelligere&mdash;quod pater meus deserviebat per xl. milites'.
With these expressions we may compare those of William fitz
Alan's tenants, who assert that his Norfolk fief 'non debet domino
Regi nisi i. militem ... ut antiqui testantur'; that his Shropshire
fief 'non debet Regi nisi x. milites in exercitu ... sicut antiqui
testantur'; and that, as to his Wiltshire fief, 'non sumus certi quod
servitium debeat Regi de hoc tenemento'. The Abbot of Chertsey,
also, states his <cite>servitium debitum</cite> with the proviso 'secundum quod
scire possumus'. These expressions explain the uncertainty as to the
<cite>servitium debitum</cite> in such cases as the See of Worcester and Ramsey
Abbey.<a id="footnotetagks95" name="footnotetagks95"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[pg 206]</span></p>

<p>The same principle applies to the relation between the tenant-in-chief
and his under-tenant. Thus the very first entry in the <cite>cartae</cite>
runs as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Willelmus de Wokindone iiij. milites et dimidium; et praeter hoc, ex
testimonio curiae meae, dimidium exigo, quem ipse se non debere defendit.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Of another tenant on the same fief we read: 'praeter hoc, <i>ex
testimonio curiae meae</i>, adhuc j. militem exigo'. Here, we see, appeal is
made not to record evidence, but to oral testimony. So, too, the
Bishop of Exeter adds this clause to his return:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Et praeter hos omnes, sicut <i>a multis audivi</i>, comes Gloucestri&aelig;, et comes
Hugo, et comes de Clare debent tenere de Exoniensi Episcopo; sed nullum
ei servitium faciunt vel recognoscunt.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Surely in all such cases as these the obvious inference is that the
tenant had been enfeoffed <i>sine carta</i>, or in the very words of the Provisions
of the Barons (1259) 'feofatus sine carta a tempore conquestus
vel alio antiquo feofamento' (&#167; 1).</p>

<p>And now for my theory. No one can have even glanced at the lists
I have compiled without being instantly struck by the fact that the
'service' is reckoned in round numbers, and is almost invariably <em>a
multiple of 5, if not of 10</em>.<a id="footnotetagks96" name="footnotetagks96"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks96"><sup>96</sup></a>
This discovery, of course, is absolutely
destructive of the view that it always represented the number of
five-hide (or &pound;20) units contained in the fief. Further, the number
of differing fiefs assessed at precisely the same figure proves that the
assessment was wholly arbitrary and cannot have been even the
round sum which approximated most nearly the number of such
units.<a id="footnotetagks97" name="footnotetagks97"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks97"><sup>97</sup></a>
What then was the true determinant in the light of these
conclusions? I reply&mdash;<em>the unit of the feudal host</em>.</p>

<p>'On the continent,' writes Gneist, 'fifty <i>milites</i>, or at least twenty-five,
were reckoned to one banneret; in England, in proportion to
the smaller scale of enfeoffments, a smaller number appears to have
formed the unit of the <i>constabularia</i>.'<a id="footnotetagks98" name="footnotetagks98"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks98"><sup>98</sup></a>
He is right: the English <i>constabularia</i>,
where I find it referred to, consists of <em>ten</em> knights.<a id="footnotetagks99" name="footnotetagks99"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks99"><sup>99</sup></a>
It is interesting to trace this unit and its multiples recurring in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[pg 207]</span>
the narratives of Irish warfare, under Henry II, and in other
struggles.<a id="footnotetagks100" name="footnotetagks100"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks100"><sup>100</sup></a>
We meet with it also in the grant by the Empress to
Geoffrey de Mandeville, in 1141, of 'feodum et servicium xx.
militum' and in Stephen's grant to him of 'lx milites feudatos'.<a id="footnotetagks101" name="footnotetagks101"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>

<p>The next step is to show that the Normans were familiar with
<cite>servitium debitum</cite> in terms of the ten-knight unit when they landed in
England. For this we have only to refer to Wace. For in the 'Roman
de Rou', as quoted by Mr Freeman himself, we find William fitz
Osbern assuring the duke as to his barons:</p>

<div class="poem width18">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Vostre servise dobleront:</p>
<p>Ki solt mener vint chevaliers</p>
<p>Quarante en merra volontiers,</p>
<p>E ki de trente servir deit</p>
<p>De sesante servir vos velt,</p>
<p>E cil ki solt servir de cent</p>
<p>Dous cent en merra bonement.<a id="footnotetagks102" name="footnotetagks102"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>The <cite>servitium debitum</cite>, therefore, was a standing institution in
Normandy, and 'to the mass of his (William's) followers', as Mr
Freeman frankly admits,<a id="footnotetagks103" name="footnotetagks103"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks103"><sup>103</sup></a> a 'feudal tenure, a military tenure, must
have seemed the natural and universal way of holding land'. When
we find them and their descendants holding their fiefs in England,
as they had been held in Normandy, by the service of a round
number of knights, what is the simple and obvious inference but
that, just as Henry II granted out the provinces of Ireland to be
held as fiefs by the familiar service of a round number of knights,<a id="footnotetagks104" name="footnotetagks104"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks104"><sup>104</sup></a>
so Duke William granted out the fiefs he formed in England?</p>

<p>If to escape from this conclusion the suggestion be made that these
<cite>servitia debita</cite> were compositions effected by English <i>antecessores</i>, it
need only be answered that the fiefs acquired were wholly new
creations, constructed from the scattered fragments of Anglo-Saxon
estates. And though in the case of the church fiefs this
objection might not apply, yet we have evidence, as I shall show, to
prove that their <cite>servitia</cite> also were determined by the conqueror's
will, as indeed might be inferred from their close correspondence
with those of the lay barons.</p>

<p>But if the lands of the conquered realm were so granted to be held
by a <cite>servitium debitum</cite> of knights, the key of the position is won, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg 208]</span>
the defenders of the existing view must retire along the whole line;
for, as Mr Freeman himself observed, 'Let it be once established
that land is held as a fief from the crown on condition of yielding
certain services to the crown, and the whole of the feudal incidents
follow naturally.'<a id="footnotetagks105" name="footnotetagks105"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks105"><sup>105</sup></a></p>

<p>I am anxious to make absolutely clear the point that between
the accepted view and the view which I advance, no compromise is
possible. The two are radically opposed. As against the theory that
the military obligation of the Anglo-Norman tenant-in-chief was
determined by the assessment of his holding, whether in hidage or in
value, I maintain that the extent of that obligation was not determined
by his holding, but was fixed in relation to, and expressed in
terms of, the <i>constabularia</i> of ten knights, the unit of the feudal host.
And I, consequently, hold that his military service was in no way
derived or developed from that of the Anglo-Saxons, but was
arbitrarily fixed by the king, from whom he received his fief, irrespectively
both of its size and of all pre-existent arrangements.
Such propositions, of course, utterly and directly traverse the view
which these passages best summarize:</p>

<blockquote><p>
The belief that William I divided the English landed property into
military fees is erroneous.... According to the extent and the nature of the
productive property it could be computed how many shields were to be
furnished by each estate, according to the gradually fixed proportion of a
&pound;20 ground-rent.<a id="footnotetagks106" name="footnotetagks106"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks106"><sup>106</sup></a></p>

<p>There is no ground for thinking that William directly or systematically
introduced any new kind of tenure into the holding of English lands. There
is nothing to suggest any such belief, either in the chronicles of his reign, in
the Survey, which is his greatest monument, in the genuine or even in the
spurious remains of his legislation.... As I have had to point out over and
over again, the grantee of William, whether the old owner or a new one,
held his land as it had been held in the days of King Edward.<a id="footnotetagks107" name="footnotetagks107"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks107"><sup>107</sup></a></p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the military tenure ... was itself introduced
by the same gradual process which we have assumed in the case of the
feudal usages in general. We have no light on the point from any original
grant made by the Conqueror to a lay follower; but ... we cannot suppose
it probable that such gifts were made on any expressed condition, or
accepted with a distinct pledge to provide a certain contingent of knights
for the king's service.<a id="footnotetagks108" name="footnotetagks108"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks108"><sup>108</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>If my own conclusions be accepted, they will not only prove
destructive of this view, but will restore, in its simplicity, a theory
which removes all difficulties, and which paves the way to a reconsideration
of other kindred problems, and to the study of that
aspect of Anglo-Norman institutions in which they represent the
feudal spirit developed on feudal lines.</p>

<h4>III. SCUTAGE, AID, AND 'DONUM'</h4>

<p>Precious for our purpose as are the <cite>cartae</cite> of 1166, their evidence, as it
stands, is incomplete. It needs to be supplemented by the early
Pipe-Rolls of Henry II's reign. By collating these two authorities we
obtain information which, singly, neither the one nor the other
could afford. All those entries on the rolls which relate to <i>scutagia</i>,
<i>auxilia</i> or <i>dona</i> require to be extracted and classified before we can
form our conclusions. Hitherto, historians have remained content
with repeating Swereford's <i>obiter dicta</i>, as extracted from the <i>Liber
Rubeus</i> by Madox, without checking these statements by the evidence
of the rolls themselves.</p>

<p>The question of Swereford's authority is one which it is absolutely
necessary to deal with, because his statements have been freely
accepted by successive historical writers, and have formed, indeed,
the basis on which their conclusions rest. Now the presumption is
naturally in favour of Swereford's knowledge of his subject. His
introduction to the <cite>Liber Rubeus</cite> is dated 1230, and he tells us that he
had been at work among the records in the days of King John, under
William of Ely<a id="footnotetagks109" name="footnotetagks109"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks109"><sup>109</sup></a>
himself: he wrote with the actual rolls before
him; he had been intimate with the leading officials of the exchequer,
and enjoyed full knowledge of its practice and its traditions.
I cannot wonder that, this being so, his positive assertions should
have been readily believed, or that Mr Hall, when, for a short time,
I was associated with him in preparing the Red Book for the press,
should, with a kindly bias in favour of so venerable an authority,
have shrunk from my drastic criticism of his famous introduction to
that volume.</p>

<p>On the other hand we have Swereford's own admission that he
worked from the rolls alone.<a id="footnotetagks110" name="footnotetagks110"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks110"><sup>110</sup></a>
These rolls are, for all purposes,
as accessible to us as they were to him, while we possess the advantage
of having, in contemporary chronicles, sources of information
which he did not use, and with which, indeed, he shows no
sign of being even conversant. We must go, therefore, behind
Swereford and examine for ourselves the materials from which he
worked.</p>

<p>Passing, for the present, over minor points, I would fix on the
'Great Scutage', or 'Scutage of Toulouse', as the test by which
Swereford's knowledge and accuracy must stand or fall. If he is in
error on this matter, his error is so grievous and so far-reaching
that it must throw the gravest doubt on all his similar assertions. The
date of the expedition against Toulouse was June 1159 (the host
having been summoned at Mid-Lent): from the chroniclers we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[pg 210]</span>
learn that, to provide the means for it, and especially to pay an
army of mercenaries, a great levy was made in England and
beyond sea. The roll of the following Michaelmas records precisely
such a levy, and the payments so recorded must have been made for
the expenses of this campaign. But we can go further still; we can
actually prove from internal evidence that sums accounted for on
the roll of 1159 were levied expressly for the Toulouse campaign.<a id="footnotetagks111" name="footnotetagks111"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks111"><sup>111</sup></a>
Yet we are confidently informed by Swereford that this levy was for a
Welsh war, and that the scutage of Toulouse is represented by the
levies which figure on the rolls of 1161 and 1162. He appears to have
evolved out of his inner consciousness the rule that a scutage, though
fixed and even paid in any given year, was never accounted for on
the rolls till the year after.<a id="footnotetagks112" name="footnotetagks112"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks112"><sup>112</sup></a> But as even this rule will not apply
to his calculation here, one can only suggest that he was absolutely
ignorant of the date of the Toulouse campaign.<a id="footnotetagks113" name="footnotetagks113"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks113"><sup>113</sup></a> The value of
Swereford's calculations is so seriously affected by this cardinal
error, that one may reject with less hesitation his statement that the
scutage of 1156 was taken for a Welsh war, and not, as there is
evidence to imply, for a campaign against the king's brother.
Swereford, again, may be pardoned for his ignorance of the fact that
scutage existed under Henry I,<a id="footnotetagks114" name="footnotetagks114"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks114"><sup>114</sup></a> but when he unhesitatingly
assigns the Domesday Survey to the fourteenth year of the Conqueror
(1079-80), he shows us that the precision of his statements is
no proof of their accuracy. On both these points he has misled subsequent
writers.<a id="footnotetagks115" name="footnotetagks115"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks115"><sup>115</sup></a></p>

<p>The incredible ignorance and credulity even of officials at the
time are illustrated by the fact that the Conqueror was generally
believed to have created 32,000 knights' fees in England, and that
Swereford plumed himself on his independence in doubting so
general a belief.<a id="footnotetagks116" name="footnotetagks116"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks116"><sup>116</sup></a> His less sceptical contemporary, Segrave, continued
to believe it, and even Madox hesitates to reject it.</p>

<p>The persistent assertion that the <i>Cartae Baronum</i> were connected
with, and preliminary to, the <cite>auxilium ad filiam maritandam</cite> of 1168 is
undoubtedly to be traced to Swereford's <cite>ipse dixit</cite> to that effect.
He distinctly asserts that the aid was fixed (<cite>assisum</cite>) in the thirteenth
year (1167), that the returns (<cite>cartae</cite>) were made in the same year
(1167), and that the aid was paid and accounted for in the fourteenth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>[pg 211]</span>
year (1168).<a id="footnotetagks117" name="footnotetagks117"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks117"><sup>117</sup></a> Modern research, however, has shown that the
returns were made quite early in 1166, while the youthful Matilda,
we know, was not married till October 1168. This throws an instructive
light on Swereford's <i>modus operandi</i>. Finding from the rolls
that the payments made in 1168 were based on the returns in the
<cite>cartae</cite>, and not being acquainted with the date of the latter, he
jumped to the conclusion that they must have been made in 1167, it
being his (quite unsupported) thesis that all levies were fixed in the
year preceding that in which they were accounted for on the rolls.</p>

<p>Proceeding further, we find him explaining (p. 9) that he omits
the aid of 1165, 'quoniam probata summa auxilii propter hoc non
probatur numerus militum'. And yet this aid, the last to be taken
before the returns of 1166, is of special value and importance for the
very purpose he speaks of. It is, indeed, an essential element in the
evidence on which I build; and this compels me to discuss the point
in some detail.</p>

<p>Those who contributed towards this aid either (1) gave arbitrary
sums for the payment of <i>servientes</i>&mdash;whose number was almost invariably
some multiple of five&mdash;or (2) paid a marc on every fee of
their <cite>servitium debitum</cite>. We are only here concerned with those who
adopted the latter course. Now let us take the case of those who
adopted this alternative in the counties of Notts and Derby, and
compare their payments with their <cite>servitium debitum</cite> as known to us
from other sources.</p>

<table summary="'aids' of 1165" border="0">

<p>In this case there is no doubt as to the <cite>servitium debitum</cite>, for it is

test, the exact correspondence of the payments, I turn to the case of
Devonshire.</p>

<p>Here we are supplied by this roll with four important <cite>servitia</cite>
which would otherwise be absolutely unknown to us. And they
happen to be of special interest. For while the <cite>carta</cite> of William de
Braose returns twenty-eight fees, and that of Oliver de Traci
twenty-three and a half (though he pays on thirty and a half),<a id="footnotetagks119" name="footnotetagks119"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks119"><sup>119</sup></a>
their payments in 1165, by revealing their <cite>servitium debitum</cite>, show us
that their fiefs represent the two halves of the Honour of Barnstaple
(which, therefore, was assessed at 50 knights) then in their respective
hands. Again, William de Traci returns his fees in his <cite>carta</cite> as twenty-five
and three-quarters, and says nothing about any balance on his
<i>dominium</i>, as he should have done. Hence we should not have known
his <cite>servitium</cite> but for the roll of 1165.</p>

<p>Swereford's extraordinary failure to understand this roll aright is
possibly due to the fact that most of the relevant payments are
entered without mention of their object. He seems to have been
very dependent upon the rolls explaining themselves, and to have
worked in the spirit of a copying clerk rather than of an intelligent
student.</p>

<p>One more example of his errors will suffice. In his abstracts from
the aid 'ad maritandam primogenitam filiam regis' (1168), we
read:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Abbas Gloucestri&aelig; de promissione, sed non numeratur quid; sed in
rotulo praecedenti dicitur:&mdash;Abbas Gloucestri&aelig; debet xxxviij. l. ij. s. vj. d. de
veteri scutagio Walliae.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Now (1) the amount of the abbot's contribution is duly entered on
the roll ('xl. marcas de promissione de eodem auxilio'), and it is not
paid in respect of fees, but is a voluntary proffer; (2) the phrase in
the preceding roll is not 'de veteri <i>scutagio</i>', but 'de veteri <i>exercitu'</i>;
(3) the payment there recorded represents a contribution of fifty
<i>servientes</i>, and had nothing to do with scutage, for the abbot (as
Swereford should have known) did not hold by military service, and
ought not, therefore, to figure in his lists at all.<a id="footnotetagks120" name="footnotetagks120"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks120"><sup>120</sup></a></p>

<p>Let us turn, therefore, to the rolls themselves. Now, although the
language of the exchequer was not so precise as we could wish, it is
possible, more or less, to distinguish and classify these levies. Thus,
we have of course a typical 'aid' in the levy for the marriage of the
king's daughter (1168), while, on the other hand, we have an
equally typical 'scutage' in 1156, in the payments made by the
church tenants in lieu of military service.</p>

<p>On the institution of 'scutage' there has been much misconception.
It is placed by our historians among the great innovations
wrought by Henry II, who is supposed by them to have introduced it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[pg 213]</span>
in 1156.<a id="footnotetagks121" name="footnotetagks121"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks121"><sup>121</sup></a> Here we see, once again, the danger of seeking our information
on such points secondhand, instead of going straight to the
fountainhead for ourselves.</p>

<p>John of Salisbury implies that scutage was no novelty in 1156
when he writes, not that the king imposed it, but that he '<em>could not
remit</em> it'. This inference is at once confirmed by the appearance of
scutage <i>eo nomine</i> in the reign of Henry I.</p>

<p>The following charter is found in the (MS.) <cite>Liber Eliensis</cite> (Lib.
III), No. xxi, and in the Cottonian MS. Nero A. 15:</p>

<blockquote><p>
H. rex Anglorum Archiepiscopis, Episcopis, Abbatibus, Comitibus, etc.
Salutem. Sciatis me condonasse Ecclesi&aelig; S. &AElig;theldred&aelig; de Ely pro Dei

Basset et Gaufrido de Clintona et Willelmo de Pondelarche. Apud Eilinges
in transitu meo.
</p></blockquote>

<p>This is followed by (No. xxii) a grant of Chatteris Abbey to the
church of Ely;<a id="footnotetagks123" name="footnotetagks123"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks123"><sup>123</sup></a> and this again is followed, in a register of Chatteris
Abbey,<a id="footnotetagks124" name="footnotetagks124"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks124"><sup>124</sup></a> by a remission of 6s 7d Wardpenny hitherto paid by that
abbey. The first and third charters receive singular confirmation,
being thus accounted for in the Pipe-Roll of Henry I:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Et idem Episcopus debet ccxl. li. ut rex clamet eum quietum de superplus
militum Episcopatus, et ut Abbatia de Cateriz sit quieta de Warpenna
(p. 44).
</p></blockquote>

<p>This entry, moreover, connects the <i>scutagium</i> with the system of
knight-service (<i>superplus militum</i>).</p>

<p>It is delicious to learn, on comparing the records, that the
virtuous king who made these grants for the weal of his parents'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[pg 214]</span>
souls and the remission of his own sins, extorted from the church, for
making them, an equivalent in hard cash.<a id="footnotetagks125" name="footnotetagks125"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks125"><sup>125</sup></a></p>

<p>Again, the (MS.) Cartulary of St Evroul contains a confirmation
by Randulf, Earl of Chester (1121-29) of his predecessor (d.
1120) Earl Richard's benefaction, 'liberam et quietam ab <i>escuagio'</i>,
etc., etc. The list of the Abbot of Peterborough's knights (see p. <a href="#page131">131</a>)
is a further illustration of knight-service <i>temp.</i> Henry I, while the
entry as to Vivian, who was enfeoffed by Abbot Turold: 'servit pro
milite <i>cum auxilio</i>' (<cite>Chron. Petrob.</cite>, p. 175), must refer to the somewhat
obscure 'auxilium militum' of the period. So also, it would
seem, must the curious charter of Eustace, Count of Boulogne,<a id="footnotetagks126" name="footnotetagks126"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks126"><sup>126</sup></a>
in which he speaks of his knights serving: 'sive <i>in nummis</i>, sive in
exercitu, sive in guarda', under Henry I. Most important of all,
however, is a passage on which I have lighted since this essay first
appeared. In reading through the letters of Herbert (Losinga),
Bishop of Norwich (d. 1119), I found this appeal to the Bishop of
Salisbury, in the king's absence from England:</p>

<blockquote><p>
In terris meis exiguntur quinquaginta libr&aelig; pro placitis, cum earundem
terrarum mei homines nec in responsionem nec in facto peccaverint.<a id="footnotetagks127" name="footnotetagks127"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks127"><sup>127</sup></a>
Item <i>pro militibus sexaginta libr&aelig;</i> quos [? quas] tanto difficilius cogor reddere,
quanto annis pr&aelig;teritis mea substantia gravius attenuata est (Ed. Giles,
p. 51).
</p></blockquote>

<p>The sum is that to which the Ely contribution is reduced by the
above charter, and the death of the writer in 1119 proves the early
date of the payment.</p>

<p>Indeed, a little consideration will show that payment in lieu of
military service, which was the essential principle of scutage, could
be no new thing. The two forms which this payment might assume&mdash;payment
to a substitute, or payment to the crown&mdash;both appear in
Domesday as applicable to the fyrd; the former is found in the
'Customs' of Berkshire, the latter in other passages. From the very
commencement of knight service, the principle must have prevailed;
for the 'baron' who had not enfeoffed knights enough to discharge his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[pg 215]</span>
<cite>servitium debitum</cite>, must always have hired substitutes to the amount of
the balance. Nor is this a matter of supposition: we know as a fact,
from the <cite>Abingdon Chronicle</cite> and the <cite>Ely History</cite>, that under William I
knights were so hired.<a id="footnotetagks128" name="footnotetagks128"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks128"><sup>128</sup></a> Here it should be noted, as a suggestive
fact, that the 'forty days' of military service, though bearing no
direct proportion either to the week or to the month, do so to the
marc and to the pound. The former represents 4d, and the latter 6d,
for each day of the military service.<a id="footnotetagks129" name="footnotetagks129"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks129"><sup>129</sup></a> It may fairly be assumed
that this normal 'scutage' would be based on the estimated cost of
substitutes paid direct. Thus the only change involved would be
that the tenant would make his payments not to substitutes, but to
the crown instead.</p>

<p>There is a valuable entry bearing on this point in the roll of
8 Henry II (p. 53). We there read:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Et in liberatione vii. militum soldariorum de toto anno quater xx. et iiii.
li. et xviii. s. et viii. d. Et in liberatione xx. servientium de toto anno xxx. li. et
vi. s. et viii. d. Et in liberatione viii. Arbalist' viii. li. et xvi. sol. Et in
liberatione v. vigilum et i. Portarii vi. li. et xvi. d.
</p></blockquote>

<p>This represents 8d a day to each of the seven knights for a year of
364 days, which, be it observed, corresponds precisely with the
statements in the <cite>Dialogus</cite>: 'Duo milites bajuli clavium quisque in
die viii. [den.] <i>ratione militiae</i>; asserunt enim quod equis necessariis et
armis instructi fore teneantur', etc. (i. 3). And so, we see, a scutage
of two marcs, such as that which was raised for the expedition of
Toulouse (1159), would represent, with singular accuracy, 8d a day
for the forty days of feudal service, or exactly a knight's pay. Again
the pay of the <i>serviens</i>, recorded in this passage, works out at a penny
a day for a year of 364 days, which has an important bearing, we
shall find, on the roll of three years later (11 Henry II). A similar
calculation shows that the porter received 2d a day, and the <i>vigil</i>
1d&mdash;the very pay assigned him in the <cite>Dialogus</cite> (i. 3). There is
another similar passage in the roll of 14 Henry II (p. 124):</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>[pg 216]</span></p>

<blockquote><p>
Et in liberatione i. militis et ii. Portariorum, et ii. vigilum de Blancmost'
xviii. li. et v. sol. Et in liberatione xl. servientum de Blancmust' de xxix.
septimanis xxxiii. li. et xvi. s. et viii. d. Et xx. servientibus qui remanserunt
xxiii. septimanas xiii. li. et viii. s. et iiii. d.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Here again the knight's pay works out at 8d a day, while the
porters, the watchmen, and the <i>servientes</i> received 1d. Specially
valuable, however, are the entries (to which no one, I think, has
drawn attention) relating to the small standing guards kept up in the
summer months at 'Walton' and Dover.<a id="footnotetagks130" name="footnotetagks130"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks130"><sup>130</sup></a> Eventually the payments
to these guards were made from the central treasury ('exitus
de thesauro'), and are therefore appended, on the rolls, to the list of
<i>combustiones</i> where no one would think of looking for them.</p>

<p>On the roll of 10 Henry II we find: 'Liberatio iiii. militum et ii.
servientum de Waletone a festo Ap. Phil' et Jac' usque ad festum S.
Luce xxiiii. li. et xx. d.' This works out at exactly 8d a day for the
<i>miles</i>, and 1d for the <i>serviens</i>. On the roll of the next year the five
knights at Dover are paid &pound;25 for 150 days' service, or exactly 8d a
day each. So too on the roll of the thirteenth year we read: 'Liberatio
iiii. militum de Waletone xxiii. li. et ix. s. et iiii. d. de clxxvi.
diebus.... Et ii. servientibus de clxxvi. diebus xxix. sol. et iiii. d.'
Here again the <i>miles</i> gets 8d, the <i>serviens</i> 1d a day. It is needless to
multiply instances, but it may be added that similar calculations
show the sailors of Richard's crusading fleet to have received 2d
and their boatswains 4d a day.</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, possible to trace a complete change of policy in this
matter by the crown. The Conqueror, we may gather from divers
hints, was anxious to push forward the process of sub-infeudation,
that as many knights as possible might be actually available for
service. As the chief danger lay, at first, in the prospect of English
revolt it was clearly his policy to strengthen to the utmost that
'Norman garrison', as we may term it, which the feudal system
enabled him to quarter on the conquered land.<a id="footnotetagks131" name="footnotetagks131"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks131"><sup>131</sup></a> But as the two
races slowly coalesced, the nature of the danger changed: it was no
longer a question of Norman <i>versus</i> Englishman, but of danger to
the crown from war abroad and feudal revolt at home. Thenceforth
its policy would be no longer to encourage personal service, but
rather payment in lieu thereof, which would provide the means of
hiring mercenaries, a more trustworthy and useful force. Clearly the
accession of the Angevin house would, and did, give to this new
policy a great impetus.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>[pg 217]</span></p>

<p>The first levy to which the rolls bear witness is that of 1156. As
this was only raised from the <em>church</em> fiefs, Henry II was, as yet, confining
himself strictly to the precedent set him, as we know, in his
grandfather's reign. This levy was at the rate of <em>one pound</em> on the
fee, and was made on the old assessment (<cite>servitium debitum</cite>).</p>

<p>I have already shown that the levy in question was not, as alleged,
an innovation. Dr Stubbs writes: 'The peculiar measure of the
second year was the collection of scutage from the knights' fees
holding of ecclesiastical superiors,<a id="footnotetagks132" name="footnotetagks132"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks132"><sup>132</sup></a> a measure which met with
much opposition from Archbishop Theobald at the time';<a id="footnotetagks133" name="footnotetagks133"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks133"><sup>133</sup></a>
and speaking of William of Newburgh, he suggests that 'possibly in
William's estimation the consent of St Thomas took from the
scutage on church fees its sacrilegious character'.<a id="footnotetagks134" name="footnotetagks134"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks134"><sup>134</sup></a> But if the institution
was fully recognized under Henry I, how was it 'sacrilegious'?
Theobald's 'opposition' in 1156 can only be inferred from the king's
reply explaining the necessity for the levy,<a id="footnotetagks135" name="footnotetagks135"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks135"><sup>135</sup></a> and was clearly
directed, not against the principle, but by way of appeal against the
necessity in that instance. Miss Norgate holds that 'no resentment
seems to have been provoked by the measure', although she sees in it
'the origin of the great institution of scutage'.<a id="footnotetagks136" name="footnotetagks136"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks136"><sup>136</sup></a> Then there is the
question of the object for which the levy was made. Swereford says
'pro exercitu Walli&aelig;',<a id="footnotetagks137" name="footnotetagks137"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks137"><sup>137</sup></a> and this misled, through Madox, Dr Stubbs
(who wrote 'the scutage of 1156 was also for the war in Wales',<a id="footnotetagks138" name="footnotetagks138"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks138"><sup>138</sup></a>)
and Gneist.<a id="footnotetagks139" name="footnotetagks139"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks139"><sup>139</sup></a> The former writer, however, has elsewhere<a id="footnotetagks140" name="footnotetagks140"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks140"><sup>140</sup></a>
pointed out that 'its object was to enable Henry to make war on his
brother'; and Miss Norgate gives the same explanation.<a id="footnotetagks141" name="footnotetagks141"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks141"><sup>141</sup></a> Swereford's
error, I believe, can undoubtedly be traced to an entry on the
Pipe-Roll of the third year (1157) recording the payment by the
Abbot of Abbotsbury of two marcs 'de exercitu Walie'.<a id="footnotetagks142" name="footnotetagks142"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks142"><sup>142</sup></a> But this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>[pg 218]</span>
must refer to the Welsh campaign of that year, not to the foreign
trouble of the year before.<a id="footnotetagks143" name="footnotetagks143"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks143"><sup>143</sup></a></p>

<p>The next levy was 'the scutage of Toulouse' in 1159. This, 'the
great scutage' of Miss Norgate,<a id="footnotetagks144" name="footnotetagks144"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks144"><sup>144</sup></a> is, strange as it may seem, on the
Pipe-Roll itself almost uniformly styled not a scutage, but a <i>donum</i>.
The explanation given by Swereford is wholly inadequate, and is
this: 'Intitulaturque illud scutagium <i>De Dono</i> ea quidem, ut
credo, ratione quod non solum prelati qui tenentur ad servitia
militaria sed etiam alii abbates, de Bello et de Salopesbiria et alii
tunc temporis dederunt auxilium'.<a id="footnotetagks145" name="footnotetagks145"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks145"><sup>145</sup></a></p>

<p>Miss Norgate, adopting this explanation, writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>
The reason doubtless is that they were assessed, as the historians tell us,
and as the roll itself shows, not only upon those estates from which services
of the shield were explicitly due, but also upon all lands held in chief of the
crown, and all church lands without distinction of tenure; the basis of assessment
in all cases being the knight's fee, in its secondary sense of a parcel of
land worth twenty pounds a year. Whatever the laity might think of this
arrangement, the indignation of the clergy was bitter and deep. The wrong
inflicted on them by the scutage of 1156 was as nothing compared with this,
which set at nought all ancient precedents of ecclesiastical immunity, and
actually wrung from the church lands even more than from the lay fiefs.<a id="footnotetagks146" name="footnotetagks146"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks146"><sup>146</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>I am obliged to quote the passage <i>in extenso</i>, because, in this case, the
accomplished writer betrays a singular confusion of ideas, and misrepresents
not only the levy, but also the point at issue. The whole
passage is conceived in error, error the more strange because Miss
Norgate enjoyed over her predecessors the advantage of writing
with the printed roll before her. The lay estates were not, as implied
('all lands held in chief of the crown'), in any way exceptionally
assessed: in no case was the basis of assessment the unit alleged by
the writer; and as to the 'church lands', a reference to the roll will
show that all over England there were only eight cases in which
those not owing 'services of the shield' contributed (and that in no
way as an assessment on imaginary knights' fees) to this levy, while
in six out of the eight their contributions were so insignificant that
their collective amount barely exceeded &pound;50.<a id="footnotetagks147" name="footnotetagks147"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks147"><sup>147</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>[pg 219]</span></p>

<p>The true explanation is probably to be found in the fact that only
a portion of the tax was raised by way of scutage. As this great levy
has been wrongly supposed to have consisted of a scutage alone,<a id="footnotetagks148" name="footnotetagks148"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks148"><sup>148</sup></a>
and as it played an important part in the development of direct
taxation, I propose to set forth, for the first time, the various
methods by which the money was raised. These were eight in
number:</p>

<p>Of these, the <em>first</em> was strictly regular, being merely a repetition
of the scutage of 1156, at the rate of two marcs instead of twenty
shillings. The <em>second</em> presents some difficulty. Subject to correction,
there are some fifteen cases in which the payment is made separately
by fiefs, and in which the rate is clearly two marcs, while there are
twenty-two in which the <i>milites</i> of the county pay as a group through
the sheriff, and in which, therefore, we cannot actually test the rate
of the levy or the manner of raising it. Swereford's <cite>ipse dixit</cite> as to the
rate in these latter cases was probably based on analogy, here our
only guide.</p>

<p>With the <em>third</em> and <em>fourth</em> divisions we return to sure ground. To
them I invite particular attention, because it is to them (and especially
to the third) that apply the complaints of the church chroniclers,
and not (as has always, but erroneously, been supposed) to the
perfectly legitimate levy of two marcs on the fee. It is necessary to
emphasize the fact that the matter has been wholly misunderstood.
The bitter complaint of John of Salisbury that Henry, on this
occasion, 'omnibus (contra antiquum morem et debitam libertatem)
indixit ecclesiis ut <i>pro arbitrio</i> ejus satraparum suorum conferrunt in
censum', would have been without meaning had it referred (as
alleged) to the latter levy (or even to the insignificant sums contributed
<i>ut supra</i> by eight foundations); but when we learn that, over
and above this legitimate levy, a far larger sum was arbitrarily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[pg 220]</span>
wrung from the church, the truth and justice of the protest are at
once made evident. I here give two tables illustrative of this exaction.
Each is divided into three columns. In the first column I give the
number of the knights due from each bishopric and each religious
house. In the second column I give the marcs due, and paid on this
occasion, on the old assessment (<cite>servitium debitum</cite>). In the third will
be found the exaction complained of, namely, the <i>dona</i> extorted
from the spiritual 'barons' themselves.</p>

<p>We thus obtain a grand total of 1,101 marcs raised from the
church by legitimate scutage, and 4,442&frac12; (or, adding the <i>dona</i>
from non-feudal houses, 4,700) marcs by special imposition.<a id="footnotetagks149" name="footnotetagks149"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks149"><sup>149</sup></a>
This distinction at once explains the real extortion of which churchmen
complained;<a id="footnotetagks150" name="footnotetagks150"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks150"><sup>150</sup></a> and shows that it had nothing to do with scutage,
but was a special imposition on the church fees from which the lay
ones were exempt.<a id="footnotetagks151" name="footnotetagks151"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks151"><sup>151</sup></a> The idea of the impost was not improbably
the adjustment of inequalities in cases where the knight-service was a
quite inadequate assessment; the precedent created was not forgotten,
and it proved in later days a welcome source of revenue.</p>

<p>The discovery of this exaction identifies, it will be seen, in spite of
Swereford's error, the levy accounted for on the roll with the
famous 'scutage of Toulouse'. And if even further proof were
needed, it is found in an incidental allusion which clinches the
argument. Giraldus Cambrensis (iii. 357) refers to Bishop Henry of
Winchester assembling all the priests of his diocese 'tanquam ad
auxilium postulandum (dederat enim paulo ante quingentas marcas
regi Henrico <i>ad expeditionem Tholosanam</i>)'. The sum here named is
that which he paid in 1159, as my table shows. Its destination is
thus established, as also, it may be noted, the means by which he was
expected to recoup himself.</p>

<p>As to the scutage on the lay fiefs, the general impression, broadly
speaking, is that Henry replaced his English feudal host by an army
of mercenaries paid from the proceeds of a scutage of two marcs per
fee on all lands held by military service.<a id="footnotetagks152" name="footnotetagks152"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks152"><sup>152</sup></a> But is that impression
confirmed by the evidence of the rolls? Without setting forth the
evidence in detail, I may sum it up as amounting to this: that the
grouped payments found under twenty-two counties<a id="footnotetagks153" name="footnotetagks153"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks153"><sup>153</sup></a> present, I
think, a total of 1,895 marcs, while those of the fiefs which paid
separately amounted to 666. This gives us a grand total of 2,561
marcs, representing, of course, 1,280 knights. Now although the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[pg 222]</span>
amount of knight service due to the crown from its English realm
has been, as we shall see, absurdly exaggerated, the above number, I
need scarcely say, must represent a minority of the knights due from
the lay fiefs. This sets the matter in quite another aspect. In spite of
the passage in Robert de Monte, on which the accepted view is
based,<a id="footnotetagks154" name="footnotetagks154"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks154"><sup>154</sup></a> the roll presents proof to the contrary, and indeed the
words of Robert show that he knew so little of the levy in England
as to believe that it was wholly arbitrary. There are, perhaps,
indications that the fiefs which, on this occasion, paid scutage, were
largely those in the king's hands,<a id="footnotetagks155" name="footnotetagks155"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks155"><sup>155</sup></a>
and if we add to these the
escheated honours, of which the scutage would be paid through the
sheriffs, we must conclude that the great bulk of the tenants who had
a choice in the matter served abroad with their contingents and did
not pay scutage.</p>

<p>Before taking leave of 'the great scutage', another point demands
notice. Gervase of Canterbury sets forth its proceeds in terms of
great precision:</p>

<p class="center2">
<i>Hoc anno</i> rex Henricus scotagium sive scutagium <i>de Anglia</i> accepit, cujus
summa fuit centum millia et quater viginti millia librarum argenti
(i. 167).
</p>

<p>Quite desperate attempts have been made to reconcile this statement
with the actual sums raised. In his preface to the <cite>Gesta Henrici Regis</cite>,
Dr Stubbs suggests that Gervase included in his total the
scutage of two years later (1161), but adds that, if so, the rolls are
very incomplete. In his <cite>Constitutional History</cite> he speaks of 'this
[scutage] and a very large accumulation of treasure from other
sources, amounting, according to the contemporary writers, to
&pound;180,000' (i. 457), but admits, in a footnote, that 'the sum is impossible',
and throws out as probable a different explanation. Miss
Norgate writes that 'the proceeds, with those of a similar tax levied
upon Henry's other dominions, amounted to some &pound;180,000'.<a id="footnotetagks156" name="footnotetagks156"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks156"><sup>156</sup></a>
But Gervase distinctly states that this sum was raised <em>from England</em>.
Now the actual sum raised, <em>by scutage</em>, in England (1159) was &pound;2,440
in all, as I reckon it, while the special clerical impost produced some
&pound;3,130 in addition. Consequently, no ingenuity can save the credit
of Gervase. He was not, after all, worse than his fellows. We shall
find that when medi&aelig;val chroniclers endeavour to foist on us these
absurd sums they require much bolder handling than they have ever
yet received.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>[pg 223]</span></p>

<p>Pass we now to the <em>third</em> levy, that of 1161. For this the rate was
again <em>two marcs</em> on the fee according to Swereford (followed, of
course, by subsequent writers), though the study of the roll (7
Henry II) reveals that in many cases, on the lay fiefs at least, the
rate was <em>one</em> marc. Both this and the levy of the following year are
most difficult to deal with in every way. We have seen that an
entry on the roll of 1163 led Swereford to believe that the levy of
1161 was made for the Toulouse campaign, and Dr Stubbs has
made the suggestion that it might have been raised to defray 'debts'
incurred on that occasion;<a id="footnotetagks157" name="footnotetagks157"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks157"><sup>157</sup></a>
but the difficulties in the way of
accepting this view seem insuperable.<a id="footnotetagks158" name="footnotetagks158"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks158"><sup>158</sup></a></p>

<p>The <em>fourth</em> levy, which is that of 1162 (8 Henry II), was at the
rate of <em>one</em> marc, and is recorded by Swereford, but not by Dr
Stubbs.<a id="footnotetagks159" name="footnotetagks159"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks159"><sup>159</sup></a>
Though richer in names than that of 1161, it is even less
useful for our purpose, as the sums entered are most irregular,
perhaps owing to the adoption of a new method of collection.<a id="footnotetagks160" name="footnotetagks160"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks160"><sup>160</sup></a>
Neither of these levies affords, in the absence of corroboration,
trustworthy evidence on the <cite>servitium</cite> of any lay fief.</p>

<p>The <em>fifth</em> levy, on the other hand, in 1165 (11 Henry II), affords
most valuable evidence, although it is ignored by Swereford and
by those who have followed him. It is, however, of a singular character.
The money was raised, we gather from the roll, on two different
systems:</p>

<p>(I) By a <em>fixed</em> payment at the rate of one marc on the fee (old
assessment).</p>

<p>(II) By an <em>arbitrary</em> payment of certain mysterious sums, which
prove to be multiples of the unit 15s 3d. But there is no fixed
proportion to be traced between the amount paid and the number
of <cite>servitia</cite> due. Numerous instances are found of a single knight's
fee being charged with a sum equivalent to five of these mysterious
units. Magnates, again, are found paying apparently strange sums,
which prove on dissection to represent 50, 100, 200 and even 300
of these units. The clue to the mystery is found in an entry on the
Pipe-Roll of the following year (12 Henry II), which proves that this
unit was the pecuniary equivalent of a <i>serviens</i>, and that the various
payers had 'promised' the king so many <i>servientes</i> for the war in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[pg 224]</span>
Wales.<a id="footnotetagks161" name="footnotetagks161"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks161"><sup>161</sup></a>
Such 'promises' were evidently offers, made independently
of the actual service due from the 'promising' party. Following up
this clue, we see that the Abbot of Abingdon must, like the Bishop of
Hereford, have promised 100 'serjeants',<a id="footnotetagks162" name="footnotetagks162"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks162"><sup>162</sup></a>
that the Abbot of St
Alban's must have done likewise,<a id="footnotetagks163" name="footnotetagks163"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks163"><sup>163</sup></a>
while the Bishop of London
must have promised 150, <em>in addition</em>, be it noted, to paying a scutage
of a marc on each knight's fee (20) of his <cite>servitium debitum</cite>.<a id="footnotetagks164" name="footnotetagks164"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks164"><sup>164</sup></a>
For the rolls of 1162 and 1163 prove that he had duly paid the
scutage of the former year, and that this was a further payment.
The varying form of these entries should be observed, for it was
evidently quite immaterial to the clerks whether they wrote '5
serjeants' or their equivalent&mdash;76 shillings and 3 pence.<a id="footnotetagks165" name="footnotetagks165"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks165"><sup>165</sup></a>
Taking
the pay of the <i>serviens</i> at 1d a day, the unit in question would
represent six months' pay (for a year of 366 days).</p>

<p>But, for our present purpose, we must confine ourselves to the
scutage proper. The passage on which I would specially dwell is
the entry on the roll in which the <i>custos</i> of the archbishopric of
Canterbury 'reddit compotum de cxiii. li. de Militibus de Archiepiscopatu
de ii. Exercitibus' (p. 109).<a id="footnotetagks166" name="footnotetagks166"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks166"><sup>166</sup></a>
In the first place, we have
here, surely, witness to the <em>two</em> Welsh campaigns of this year, which
Mr Eyton adopts, following Mr Bridgeman,<a id="footnotetagks167" name="footnotetagks167"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks167"><sup>167</sup></a>
but which Miss
Norgate rejects.<a id="footnotetagks168" name="footnotetagks168"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks168"><sup>168</sup></a>
Secondly, this sum resolves itself, on analysis,
into two constituents of 84&frac34; marcs each. Now the return for the
archbishopric the following year is: 'Archiepiscopus habet iiij<sup>xx.</sup> et
iiij<sup>or.</sup> et dimidium et quartam partem feffatos.'<a id="footnotetagks169" name="footnotetagks169"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks169"><sup>169</sup></a>
Having set forth
this exact corroboration, I will briefly trace the <cite>servitium</cite> of the See.
In 1156 and 1159 it pays no scutage when the other church fiefs
do, but within six months of Theobald's death it pays to the scutage
of 1161 on a <cite>servitium</cite> of sixty knights, being then in the hands of the
crown. Under Becket, in 1162, it is once more omitted; but in 1165
it again pays, as we have seen, and now not on sixty knights but on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[pg 225]</span>
84&frac34;. In 1168 it contributes, on the same amount, to the <i>auxilium</i>,
and in 1172, but the latter year is the first in which the <i>recognoscit</i>
formula is employed, enabling us to determine that, as in 1161,
the <cite>servitium debitum</cite> was sixty knights.</p>

<p>The typical difference between these sixty knights and the
84&frac34; actually enfeoffed will serve to illustrate the point on which I
insist throughout. Had the fee been held by its tenant, he would
have raised 84&frac34; marcs, paid sixty to the crown, and kept 24&frac34; for
himself.<a id="footnotetagks170" name="footnotetagks170"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks170"><sup>170</sup></a>
But when a <i>custos</i> held the fief, he could keep nothing
back, and therefore paid over the whole. We have, I think, an
illustration of the same kind in the payment (p. 202, note 76) by
the <i>custos</i> of the Romare fief, 'de noviter feffatis' (<i>noviter</i>, be it observed
not yet <i>de novo</i>).</p>

<p>Having brought the levies down to 1165, I hope it has now been
made clear that the officials of the exchequer were well aware of the
amount of <cite>servitium debitum</cite> from every fief, the levies being always
based on the said amount. Swereford, therefore, was quite mistaken
in the inference he drew from the inquest of 1166:<a id="footnotetagks171" name="footnotetagks171"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks171"><sup>171</sup></a>
indeed, his
words prove that he completely misunderstood the problem.</p>

<p>This was the last levy raised previous to the making of the
returns (<cite>cartae</cite>) in 1166. These returns were followed in 1168 by the
first levy on the new assessment. I have already dealt with the
changes which this new assessment involved, but I would here again
insist upon the fact that the church and the lay fiefs were not dealt
with alike, the latter being assessed wholly <i>de novo</i>, while the former
retained their old assessments, while accounting separately, and
under protest, for the fees in excess of their <cite>servitium debitum</cite>. So
far as the lay fiefs were concerned, their <cite>servitia</cite>, congenital with
Norman rule, were now swept away. Here, from the single county of
Northumberland, are three cases in point:</p>

<p>The change thus made by the restless king was permanent in its
effect, and thenceforth the only assessment recognized was that
based upon the fees, which, by 1166, had been created de veteri and
de novo.<a id="footnotetagks174" name="footnotetagks174"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks174"><sup>174</sup></a></p>

<p>Before leaving the subject of this levy, there is one point on which
I would touch. When we find, as we often do, that the sum paid in
1168 in respect of a fief does not tally with the number of fees
recorded in the <cite>cartae</cite>, we must remember that in the <cite>Liber Niger</cite>
and <cite>Liber Rubeus</cite> we have not the original <cite>cartae</cite>, but only transcripts
liable to clerical error. Checking the <cite>cartae</cite> by these payments,
we constantly find cases in which the number of fees should be
slightly greater than is recorded in the <cite>carta</cite>.<a id="footnotetagks175" name="footnotetagks175"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks175"><sup>175</sup></a>
I suspect that the
transcriber, in these cases, has omitted entries in the original <cite>carta</cite>,
and this suspicion is strongly confirmed by the fact that where the
original return enables us to test the transcript, we find in the great
<cite>carta</cite> for the honour of Clare that the original transcriber has
omitted half a fee of William de Hastinges, has left out altogether
the entry 'Reginaldus de Cruce, <i>dimidium militem</i>', and has changed
the quarter fee of Geoffrey fitz Piers into half a fee; while in that of
the Bishop of Chichester, Robert de Denton's half fee is converted
into a whole one. The later (Red Book) transcriber has made
a further omission.</p>

<p>Another source of discrepancy may be found in the dangerous
resemblance of formulae. Thus the <cite>carta</cite> of Ranulf fitz Walter records
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[pg 227]</span>
three and three-quarter fees duly accounted for. Yet his payment in
1168 is not &pound;2 10s but &pound;2 4s 5d. The explanation is that the holding
was really three and one-third fees,<a id="footnotetagks176" name="footnotetagks176"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks176"><sup>176</sup></a>
but the transcriber read
'iij[<sup>a.</sup>] pars' (one-third) as 'iij. partes' (three-quarters).</p>

<p>How easily such errors arose may be seen in the elaborate entries
on Simon de Beauchamp's fief. Here the formula 'decem denarios
quando Rex accipit marcam de milite', correctly reproduced in the
Black Book, becomes 'x. denarius', etc., in the Red Book. The
former expression means '<em>tenpence</em> in the marc' (<i>i.e.</i> one-sixteenth of a
fee); whereas the latter is equivalent to '<em>the tenth penny</em> in the marc'
(<i>i.e.</i> one-tenth of a fee), and upsets the whole reckoning. The correct
formula is a not uncommon one and should be compared with the
'de xx. solidis viii. denarios' (eightpence in the pound) which is
given as the holding of two knights of the honour of Clare, and
represents the thirtieth of a fee.<a id="footnotetagks177" name="footnotetagks177"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks177"><sup>177</sup></a></p>

<p>Lastly, I think that, on further examination, there are three
fiefs of which the <cite>servitia debita</cite>, though at first sight irregular,<a id="footnotetagks178" name="footnotetagks178"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks178"><sup>178</sup></a>
may fairly be brought into line as multiples of the <i>constabularia</i>.
That of Bohun, though implied by the <cite>carta</cite> to be thirty and a half
knights, paid in the fifth and eighth years on exactly thirty; that of
Malet, though similarly given as twenty and one-sixth in the
<cite>carta</cite>, is returned in the <cite>Testa de Nevill</cite> as exactly twenty;<a id="footnotetagks179" name="footnotetagks179"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks179"><sup>179</sup></a> that
of Beauchamp of Hacche, though distinctly given as seventeen in
the <cite>carta</cite>, will be found, on careful collation of the rolls for 7 and
8 Hen. II, to be claimed by the exchequer as 17 + 3, <i>i.e.</i> 20.</p>

<p>Here also, perhaps, it may be allowable to glance at the foreign
parallels to fiefs of sixty fees and smaller multiples of five. There is
a charter of Charles the Fair (1322-28) 'qua Alphonsum de Hispania
"Baronem et Ricum Hominem" Navarr&aelig; creat; et, ut Baronis et
Rici Hominis statum manu tenere possit, eidem de gratia speciali 60
militias [knight's fees] in regno sua Navarr&aelig; concedit modo consueto
tenendos et possidendos',<a id="footnotetagks180" name="footnotetagks180"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks180"><sup>180</sup></a> while an edict of earlier date proclaims:
'De Vasvassore [<i>i.e.</i> baron] qui <i>quinque milites</i> habet, per
mortem [? pro morte] ejus, emendetur 60 unci&aelig; auri cocti, et per
plagam [? pro plaga] 30, et si plures habuerit milites, crescat compositio
sicut numerus militum.'<a id="footnotetagks181" name="footnotetagks181"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks181"><sup>181</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[pg 228]</span></p>

<h4>IV. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF KNIGHTS DUE</h4>

<p>'Ad hoc solicitius animum direxi ut per regna Angli&aelig; debita Regi
servitia militaria quatinus potui plenissime percunctarer.'<a id="footnotetagks182" name="footnotetagks182"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks182"><sup>182</sup></a> So
writes Swereford, who proceeds to explain that neither the famous
Bishop Nigel himself, nor his successor, Bishop Richard, nor William
of Ely (<i>ut supra</i>) had left any certain information on the subject;
while he (Swereford) could not accept the common belief that the
Conqueror had created <cite>servitia</cite> of knights to the amount of 32,000.<a id="footnotetagks183" name="footnotetagks183"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks183"><sup>183</sup></a>
The cause of his failure is found in the fact that he confused two
different things: (1) the <cite>debita Regi servitia</cite>, which formed the only
assessment of fiefs down to 1166; (2) the assessment based on the
<cite>cartae</cite> of 1166, which superseded the <cite>debita servitia</cite>, and is not evidence
of their amount.<a id="footnotetagks184" name="footnotetagks184"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks184"><sup>184</sup></a> But then, as I have already explained above,
the exchequer official was concerned only with the actual claims of
the crown; for him the original 'service due' had a merely academic
interest.</p>

<p>There are two estimates for the total of which we are in search.
One is 32,000 knights; the other 60,000.</p>

<p>'Stephen Segrave,' Dr Stubbs reminds us, 'the minister of Henry
III, reckoned 32,000 as the number' (which confirms Swereford's
statement); but he himself wisely declines to hazard 'a conjectural
estimate',<a id="footnotetagks185" name="footnotetagks185"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks185"><sup>185</sup></a> adding that 'the official computation, on which the
scutage was levied, reckoned in the middle of the thirteenth century
32,000 knights' fees, but the amount of money actually raised by
Henry II on this account, in any single year, was very far from
commensurate'. Gneist repeats this figure, but holds that 'as far as
we may conjecture by reference to later statements, the number of
shields may be fixed at about 30,000'.<a id="footnotetagks186" name="footnotetagks186"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks186"><sup>186</sup></a></p>

<p>On the wondrous estimate of 60,000 I have more to say. Started by
Ordericus,<a id="footnotetagks187" name="footnotetagks187"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks187"><sup>187</sup></a> this venerable fable has been handed down by Higden
and others, till in the <cite>Short History of the English People</cite> it has attained
a world-wide circulation.<a id="footnotetagks188" name="footnotetagks188"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks188"><sup>188</sup></a> Dr Stubbs has rightly dismissed the
statement 'as one of the many numerical exaggerations of the early
historians';<a id="footnotetagks189" name="footnotetagks189"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks189"><sup>189</sup></a> but neither he nor any other writer has detected, so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[pg 229]</span>
far as I know, the peculiar interest of the sum. What that interest is
will be seen at once when I say that Ordericus, who asserts that the
Conqueror had so apportioned the knight-service 'ut Angli&aelig;
regnum lx. millia militum indesinenter haberet' (iv. 7), also alleges
that the number present at the famous Salisbury assembly (1086)
was 60,000. It is very instructive to compare this 'body whose
numbers were handed down by tradition as no less than sixty
thousand',<a id="footnotetagks190" name="footnotetagks190"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks190"><sup>190</sup></a> with the 'sixty thousand horsemen'<a id="footnotetagks191" name="footnotetagks191"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks191"><sup>191</sup></a>&mdash;'ut ferunt
sexaginta millia equitum'&mdash;of thirteen years earlier, and with the
number of the Norman invaders, 'commonly given at sixty thousand',<a id="footnotetagks192" name="footnotetagks192"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks192"><sup>192</sup></a>
of seven years earlier still. It is Ordericus, too, who states
that the treasure in Normandy at the death of Henry I was &pound;60,000.
His father seems to have left behind him the same sum at Winchester,
for, though the chronicle left the amount in doubt, 'Henry of
Huntingdon,' Mr Freeman observed, with a touch of just sarcasm,
'knew the exact amount of the silver, sixty thousand pounds, one
doubtless for each knight's fee'.<a id="footnotetagks193" name="footnotetagks193"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks193"><sup>193</sup></a> He also reminds us, as to the
crusade of William of Aquitaine, that 'Orderic allows only thirty
thousand. In William of Malmesbury they have grown into sixty
thousand. Figures of this kind, whether greater or smaller, are
always multiples of one another'.<a id="footnotetagks194" name="footnotetagks194"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks194"><sup>194</sup></a></p>

<p>Pursuing the subject, we learn from Giraldus that the Conqueror's
annual income was 60,000 marcs.<a id="footnotetagks195" name="footnotetagks195"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks195"><sup>195</sup></a> Fantosme speaks of
marshalled knights as</p>

<blockquote><p>
<i>Meins de</i> seisante mile, <i>e plus de seisante treis,</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p>and the author of the Anglo-Norman poem on the conquest of
Ireland gives the strength of the Irish host, in 1171, as 60,000 men.
Even 'Sir Bevis', if I remember right, slew in the streets of London
60,000 men; and Fitz Stephen asserts that, in Stephen's reign,
London was able to turn out 60,000 foot.<a id="footnotetagks196" name="footnotetagks196"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks196"><sup>196</sup></a> It may, also, not
be without significance that 60,000 Moors are said to have been
slain at Navas de Tolosa, and that William of Sicily was said to have
bequeathed to Henry II three distinct sums of 60,000 each.<a id="footnotetagks197" name="footnotetagks197"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks197"><sup>197</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[pg 230]</span></p>

<p>The fact is that 'sixty thousand' was a favourite phrase for a
great number, and that 'sixty' was used in this sense just as the
Romans<a id="footnotetagks198" name="footnotetagks198"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks198"><sup>198</sup></a> had used it in classical times and just as Russian peasants
(I think I have read) use it to this day. The 'twice six hundred
thousand men', who were burning to fight for England,<a id="footnotetagks199" name="footnotetagks199"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks199"><sup>199</sup></a> and the
&pound;180,000 (60,000 &#215; 3) of Gervase (1159), are traceable, doubtless,
to the same source.</p>

<p>How strangely different from these wild figures are the sober
facts of the case! The whole of the church fiefs, as we have seen,
were only liable to find 784 knights, a number which, small as it
was, just exceeded the entire knight service of Normandy as returned
in 1171. As to the lay fiefs it is not possible to speak with equal confidence.
I have ventured to fix the approximate <i>quota</i> of 104 (more
or less), of which ninety-two are in favour of my theory: forty-eight
fiefs, of five knights and upwards, remain undetermined.<a id="footnotetagks200" name="footnotetagks200"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks200"><sup>200</sup></a> If the
average of knights to a fief were the same in the latter as in the
former class, the total contingents of the lay barons would amount,
apparently, to 3,534 knights; but, as the latter one includes such
enormous fiefs as those of Gloucester and of Clare, with such important
honours as those of Peverel and Eye, we must increase our
estimate accordingly, and must also make allowance for fiefs omitted
and for those owing less than five knights (which are comparatively
unimportant).</p>

<p>Making, therefore, every allowance, we shall probably be safe in
saying that the whole <cite>servitium debitum</cite>, clerical and lay, of England
can scarcely have exceeded, if indeed it reached, 5,000 knights.</p>

<p>Indefinite though such a result may seem, it is worth obtaining
for the startling contrast which it presents to the 60,000 of Ordericus,
to the 32,000 of Segrave,<a id="footnotetagks201" name="footnotetagks201"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks201"><sup>201</sup></a> and to the 30,000 of Gneist. The only
writer, so far as I know, who has approximated, by investigating
for himself, the true facts of the case, is Mr Pearson;<a id="footnotetagks202" name="footnotetagks202"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks202"><sup>202</sup></a> but his
calculations, I fear, are vitiated by the unfortunate guess that the
alleged 32,000 fees were really 6,400 of five hides each. It is a hopeless
undertaking to reconcile the facts with the wild figures of
medi&aelig;val historians by resorting to the ingenious devices of apocalyptic
interpretation.</p>

<h4>V. THE NORMAL KNIGHT'S FEE</h4>

<p>Much labour has been vainly spent on attempts to determine the
true area of a knight's fee. The general impression appears to be
that it contained five hides. Mr Pearson, we have seen, based on that
assumption his estimate of 6,400 fees, and other writers have treated
the fee as the recognized equivalent of five hides. The point is of
importance, because if we found that the recognized area of a
knight's fee was five hides, it would give us a link between the under-tenant
(<i>miles</i>) and the Anglo-Saxon thegn. But, as Dr Stubbs has
recognized, the assumption cannot be maintained; no fixed number
of hides constituted a knight's fee.</p>

<p>The circumstance of a fee, in many cases consisting of five hides,
is merely, I think, due to the existence of five-hide estates, survivals
from the previous <i>r&eacute;gime</i>. We have an excellent instance of such fees
in a very remarkable document, which has hitherto, it would seem,
remained unnoticed. This is a transcript, in Heming's Cartulary, of
a hidated survey of the Gloucestershire Manors belonging to the See
of Worcester. I believe it to be earlier than Domesday itself, in which
case, of course, it would possess a unique interest. Here are the
entries, side by side, relating to the great episcopal Manor of
Westbury (on Trym), Gloucestershire.</p>

<p>The three five-hide holdings, we find, figure in both alike, but
Gilbert fitz Thorold's holding of three hides and a half appears in
addition in Domesday. The inference, surely would seem to be that
Gilbert was enfeoffed between the date of the survey recorded in the
Cartulary and the date of the Domesday Survey. If so, the former
survey is, as I have suggested, the earlier; and in that survey we
have the three tenants of five-hide holdings described <i>eo nomine</i> as
the bishop's <i>milites</i>.</p>

<p>In the <cite>cartae</cite> of 1166 we have fees of 5 hides,<a id="footnotetagks204" name="footnotetagks204"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks204"><sup>204</sup></a>
of 4,<a id="footnotetagks205" name="footnotetagks205"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks205"><sup>205</sup></a>
of 6,<a id="footnotetagks206" name="footnotetagks206"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks206"><sup>206</sup></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>[pg 232]</span>
of 10,<a id="footnotetagks207" name="footnotetagks207"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks207"><sup>207</sup></a>
of 2&frac12;,<a id="footnotetagks208" name="footnotetagks208"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks208"><sup>208</sup></a>
and even of 2;<a id="footnotetagks209" name="footnotetagks209"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks209"><sup>209</sup></a>
also of 5 carucates,<a id="footnotetagks210" name="footnotetagks210"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks210"><sup>210</sup></a>
of 11,<a id="footnotetagks211" name="footnotetagks211"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks211"><sup>211</sup></a>
and of 14.<a id="footnotetagks212" name="footnotetagks212"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks212"><sup>212</sup></a> Cartularies, however, are richer in evidence of this
discrepancy. Thus the six fees of St Albans contained 40 hides (an
average of 6&#8532; hides each), the figures being 5&frac12;, 7, 8&frac12;, 6, 5&frac12;, 7&frac12;.<a id="footnotetagks213" name="footnotetagks213"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks213"><sup>213</sup></a>
So too in the Abingdon Cartulary (ii. 3) we find four fees containing
19 hides, three containing 14, a half-fee 4, a fee and a half 13, one
fee, 10, 5, 9. On the other hand, if we take 20 <i>librates</i> as the amount
of the fee&mdash;which it was already, as Dr Stubbs observes, in the days
of the Conqueror&mdash;the <cite>cartae</cite> confirm that conclusion.<a id="footnotetagks214" name="footnotetagks214"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks214"><sup>214</sup></a> We must
therefore conclude that the knight's fee, held by an under-tenant,
consisted normally of an estate, worth &pound;20 a year, and was not
based on the 'five hides' of the Anglo-Saxon system.</p>

<h4>VI. THE EARLY EVIDENCE<a name="page232a" id="page232a"></a></h4>

<p>We will now work upwards from the <cite>cartae</cite> to the Conquest.</p>

<p>Allusions to early enfeoffment are scattered through the <cite>cartae</cite>
themselves. Henry fitz Gerold begins his return: 'Isti sunt milites
Eudonis Dapiferi', and Eudo, we know, 'came in with the Conqueror'.
We learn from another return (<cite>Lib. Rub.</cite>, p. 397) that
Henry I had given William de Albini, 'Pincerna, de feodo quod fuit
Corbuchun xv. milites feffatos'. Now this refers to 'Robertus filius
Corbution', a Domesday tenant in Norfolk. The <cite>Testa</cite>, again, comes
to our help. Thus we learn from Domesday that Osbern the priest
<i>alias</i> Osbern the sheriff (of Lincolnshire) was William de Perci's
tenant at Wickenby, co. Lincoln, but the <cite>Testa</cite> entry (p. 338<i>a</i>) proves
that William had enfeoffed him in that holding by the service of one
knight.<a id="footnotetagks215" name="footnotetagks215"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks215"><sup>215</sup></a> So too Count Alan (of Brittany) had enfeoffed his tenant
Landri at Welton in the same county for the service of half a knight
(<cite>Ibid.</cite>, 338<i>b</i>), and we find his son, Alan fitz Landri, tenant there to
Count Stephen, a generation later than Domesday, in the Lindsey
Survey. The barony of Bywell in Northumberland, we read in the
<cite>Testa</cite> (p. 392<i>a</i>), had been held by the service of five knights<a id="footnotetagks216" name="footnotetagks216"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks216"><sup>216</sup></a> since
the days of William Rufus, who had granted it on that tenure.<a id="footnotetagks217" name="footnotetagks217"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks217"><sup>217</sup></a>
After this we are not surprised to learn that the barony of Morpeth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[pg 233]</span>
had been held 'from the Conquest' by the service of four knights,
and that of Mitford as long by the service of five (<cite>Ibid.</cite>, p. 392<i>b</i>), or
that those of Calverdon, Morewic, and Diveleston had all been
similarly held by military service 'from the Conquest'. In Herefordshire,
again, John de Monmouth is returned as holding 'feoda xv.
militum a conquestu Anglie'.<a id="footnotetagks218" name="footnotetagks218"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks218"><sup>218</sup></a> So too Robert Foliot claims in his
<cite>carta</cite> (1166) that his predecessors had been enfeoffed 'since the conquest
of England';<a id="footnotetagks219" name="footnotetagks219"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks219"><sup>219</sup></a> and William de Colecherche, that his little fief
was 'de antiquo tenemento a Conquestu Angliae' (<cite>L.R.</cite>, p. 400);
Humphrey de Bohun enumerates the fees 'quibus avus suus feffatus
fuit in primo feffamento quod in Anglia habuit' (<cite>Ibid.</cite>, p. 242), and
refers to his grandfather's subsequent enfeoffments in the days of
William Rufus (p. 244), while Alexander de Alno similarly speaks
of sub-infeudation 'tempore Willelmi Regis' (p. 230). To take one
more instance from the <cite>cartae</cite>, an abbot sets forth his <i>servicium</i> due to
Henry, 'sicuti debuit antiquitus regibus predecessoribus ejus' (p.
224). This brings us to the instructive case of Ramsey Abbey.</p>

<p>Dr Stubbs refers to a document of the reign of William Rufus as
'proof that the lands of the house had not yet been divided into
knights' fees'.<a id="footnotetagks220" name="footnotetagks220"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks220"><sup>220</sup></a> But he does not mention the striking fact that the
special knight service for which the abbot was to be liable is distinctly
stated to have been that for which his 'predecessors' had been
liable.<a id="footnotetagks221" name="footnotetagks221"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks221"><sup>221</sup></a> As this charter is assigned to 1091-1100, the mention of
'predecessors' would seem to carry back this knight service very far
indeed. And we have happily another connecting link which carries
downwards the history of this knight service, as the above-named
charter carries it upwards. This is the entry in the Pipe-Roll of
1129-30:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Abbas de Ramesia reddit compotum de xlviij. li. xj. s. et vj. d. pro superplus
militum qui requirebantur de Abbatia (p. 47).<a id="footnotetagks222" name="footnotetagks222"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks222"><sup>222</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Further, we have a notable communication to the abbot from
Bishop Nigel of Ely, which must refer to the scutage of 1156 or to
that of 1159 (probably the former):</p>

<blockquote><p>
Sciatis quod ubi Ricardus clericus<a id="footnotetagks223" name="footnotetagks223"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks223"><sup>223</sup></a> reddidit compotum de scutagio militum
vestrorum ad Scaccarium ego testificatus sum vos non debere regi
plusquam quatuor milites, et per tantum quieti estis et in rotulo scripti.<a id="footnotetagks224" name="footnotetagks224"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks224"><sup>224</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>[pg 234]</span></p>

<p>Lastly, we have the return in the Black Book (1166):</p>

<blockquote><p>
Homines faciunt iiii. milites in communi in servitium domini regis, ita
quod tota terra abbatiae communicata est cum eis per hidas ad pr&aelig;dictum
servitium faciendum.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Prof Maitland, writing on the Court of the Abbey of Ramsey, in
the thirteenth century, observes that:</p>

<blockquote><p>
The Abbot is bound to provide four knights, and (contrary to what is
thought to have been the common practice) he has not split up his land into
knights' fees so that on every occasion the same four tenants shall go to the
war ... the process by which the country was carved out into knights' fees
seems in this case to have been arrested at an early stage.<a id="footnotetagks225" name="footnotetagks225"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks225"><sup>225</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>The case of Ramsey was undoubtedly peculiar, but in the third
volume of the Cartulary, now published, we have (pp. 48, 218)
fuller versions of the Abbot's return in 1166. The second of these is
specially noteworthy, and reads like a transcript of the original
return.<a id="footnotetagks226" name="footnotetagks226"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks226"><sup>226</sup></a> Here we see separate knights' fees duly entered, with the
customary formula 'debet unum militem'. But the service was certainly
provided in 1166 and afterwards 'per hidas'. Further inquiry,
therefore, is needed; but we have in any case, for Ramsey, a chain of
evidence which should prove of considerable value for the study of
this difficult problem.</p>

<p>The phenomenon, however, for which we have to account is the
appearance from the earliest period to which our information extends
of certain quotas of knight-service, clearly arbitrary in amount,
as due from those bishops and abbots who held by military service.
When and how were these <i>quotas</i> fixed? The answer is given by
Matthew Paris&mdash;one of the last quarters in which one would think
of looking&mdash;where we read that, in 1070, the Conqueror</p>

<blockquote><p>
episcopatus quoque et abbatias omnes quae baronias tenebant, et eatenus
ab omni servitute seculari libertatem habuerant, sub servitute statuit militari,
inrotulans episcopatus et abbatias <i>pro voluntate sua</i> quot milites sibi et
successoribus suis hostilitatis tempore voluit a singulis exhiberi (<cite>Historia
Anglorum</cite>, i. 13).
</p></blockquote>

<p>This passage (which perhaps represents the St Albans tradition) is
dismissed by Dr Stubbs as being probably 'a mistaken account of the
effects of the Domesday Survey'.<a id="footnotetagks227" name="footnotetagks227"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks227"><sup>227</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>[pg 235]</span></p>

<p>But the Abingdon Chronicle, quite independently, gives the same
explanation, and traces the <i>quota</i> of knights to the action taken by
the Crown:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Quum jam regis edicto in annalibus annotarentur quot de episcopiis
quotve de abbatiis ad publicam rem tuendam milites (si forte hinc quid
causae propellendae contingeret) exigerentur, etc.<a id="footnotetagks228" name="footnotetagks228"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks228"><sup>228</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Moreover, the Ely Chronicle bears the same witness, telling us that
William Rufus, at the commencement of his reign,</p>

<blockquote><p>
<i>debitum servitium quod pater suus imposuerat</i> ab ecclesiis violenter exigit.<a id="footnotetagks229" name="footnotetagks229"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks229"><sup>229</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>It also tells us that, when undertaking his campaign against Malcolm
(1072), the Conqueror</p>

<blockquote><p>
jusserat tam abbatibus quam episcopis totius Angliae <i>debita militiae obsequia</i>
transmitti;<a id="footnotetagks230" name="footnotetagks230"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks230"><sup>230</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>and it also describes how he fixed the <i>quota</i> of knights due by an
arbitrary act of will.<a id="footnotetagks231" name="footnotetagks231"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks231"><sup>231</sup></a> The chronicler, like Matthew Paris, lays
stress upon the facts that (1) the burden was a wholly new one;
(2) its incidence was determined by the royal will alone.<a id="footnotetagks232" name="footnotetagks232"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks232"><sup>232</sup></a></p>

<p>Here, perhaps, we have the clue to the (rare) clerical exemptions
from the burden of military tenure, such as the abbeys of Gloucester
and of Battle.<a id="footnotetagks233" name="footnotetagks233"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks233"><sup>233</sup></a></p>

<p>The beginnings of sub-infeudation consequent on the Conqueror's
action are distinctly described in the cases of Abingdon and Ely, and
alluded to in those of Peterborough<a id="footnotetagks234" name="footnotetagks234"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks234"><sup>234</sup></a> and Evesham. At the first of
these, Athelelm</p>

<blockquote><p>
primo quidem stipendariis in hoc utebatur.  At his sopitis incursibus ...
abbas mansiones possessionum ecclesiae pertinentibus inde delegavit,
edicto cuique tenore parendi de suae portionis mansione.<a id="footnotetagks235" name="footnotetagks235"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks235"><sup>235</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[pg 236]</span></p>

<p>At Ely, the abbot</p>

<blockquote><p>
habuit ex consuetudine, secundum jussum regis, pr&aelig;taxatum militiae
numerum infra aulam ecclesiae, victum cotidie de manu celerarii capientem
atque stipendia, quod intollerabiliter et supra modum potuit vexare locum.... Ex
hoc compulsus quasdam terras sanct&aelig; &AElig;deldredae invasoribus in
feudum permisit tenere ... ut in omni expeditione regi observarent, [et]
ecclesia perpetim infatigata permaneret.<a id="footnotetagks236" name="footnotetagks236"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks236"><sup>236</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>For Canterbury we have remarkable evidence, not, it would
seem, generally known. In Domesday, of course, Lanfranc's <i>milites</i>
figure prominently; but the absence of a detailed return in 1166
leaves their names and services obscure. Now in the Christ Church
Domesday there is a list of the Archbishop's knights,<a id="footnotetagks237" name="footnotetagks237"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks237"><sup>237</sup></a> in which are
names corresponding with those of his tenants in 1086. It can,
therefore, be little, if at all, later than the Conqueror's reign. It is
drawn up exactly like a <cite>carta</cite> of 1166, giving the names of the knights
and the service due from each. Its editor, instead of printing this
important document in full, has, unfortunately, given us six names
only, and&mdash;mistaking the familiar 'd[imidium]' and 'q[uarterium]'
of the list for 'd[enarios]' and 'q[uadrans]'&mdash;asserts that the contributions
of the knights are 'evidently ... expressed in terms of the
shilling and its fractions',<a id="footnotetagks238" name="footnotetagks238"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks238"><sup>238</sup></a> thus missing the essential point, namely,
that they are expressed in terms of knight service.</p>

<p>As Lanfranc had done at Canterbury, as Symeon at Ely, as
Walter at Evesham, as Athelelm at Abingdon, so also did Geoffrey at
Tavistock,<a id="footnotetagks239" name="footnotetagks239"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks239"><sup>239</sup></a> and so we cannot doubt, did Wulfstan at Worcester.
The <cite>carta</cite> of his successor (1166) distinctly implies that before his
death he had carved some thirty-seven fees out of the episcopal fief.
Precisely as at Ely, he found this plan less intolerable than the
standing entertainment of a roistering troop of knights.<a id="footnotetagks240" name="footnotetagks240"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks240"><sup>240</sup></a></p>

<p>The influence of nepotism on sub-infeudation, in the case of ecclesiastical
fiefs, is too important to be passed over. On every side we
find the efforts of prelates and abbots thus to provide for their relatives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[pg 237]</span>
opposed and denounced by the bodies over which they ruled.
The Archbishop of York in his <cite>carta</cite> explains the excessive number of
his knights: 'Antecessores enim nostri, non pro necessitate servitii,
quod debent, sed quia cognatis et servientibus suis providere volebant,
plures quam debebant Regi feodaverunt.' The Abbot of Ely,
we are told by his panegyrist, enfeoffed knights by compulsion, 'non
ex industria aut favore divitum vel propinquorum affectu'.<a id="footnotetagks241" name="footnotetagks241"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks241"><sup>241</sup></a> Abbot
Athelelm of Abingdon, says his champion, enfeoffed knights of
necessity;<a id="footnotetagks242" name="footnotetagks242"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks242"><sup>242</sup></a> but a less friendly chronicler asserts that, like Thorold
of Peterborough, he brought over from Normandy his kinsmen, and
quartered them on the abbey lands.<a id="footnotetagks243" name="footnotetagks243"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks243"><sup>243</sup></a> The Tavistock charter of
Henry I restored to that abbey the lands which Guimund, its
simoniacal abbot (1088-1102), had bestowed on his brother William.
Abbot Walter of Evesham and his successor persisted in enfeoffing
knights 'contradicente capitulo'.<a id="footnotetagks244" name="footnotetagks244"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks244"><sup>244</sup></a></p>

<p>So, during a vacancy at Abbotsbury under Henry I, 'cum Rogerus
Episcopus habuit custodiam Abbati&aelig;, duas hidas, ad maritandam
quandam neptem suam, dedit N. de M., contradicente conventu
Ecclesi&aelig;'.<a id="footnotetagks245" name="footnotetagks245"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks245"><sup>245</sup></a> Henry of Winchester has left us a similar record of the
action of his predecessors at Glastonbury.<a id="footnotetagks246" name="footnotetagks246"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks246"><sup>246</sup></a> His narrative is specially
valuable for the light it throws on the power of subsequent revocation,
perhaps in cases where the corporate body had protested at the
time against the grant. Of this we have a striking instance in the
grants of Abbot &AElig;thelwig of Evesham, almost all of which, we read,
were revoked by his successor.<a id="footnotetagks247" name="footnotetagks247"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks247"><sup>247</sup></a> Parallel rather to the cases of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[pg 238]</span>
Middleton and Abbotsbury (<i>vide cartas</i>) would be the action of
William Rufus during the Canterbury vacancy.<a id="footnotetagks248" name="footnotetagks248"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks248"><sup>248</sup></a></p>

<p>It was to guard against the nepotism of the heads of monastic
houses that such a clause as this was occasionally inserted:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Terras censuales non in feudum donet: nec faciat milites nisi in sacra
veste Christi.<a id="footnotetagks249" name="footnotetagks249"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks249"><sup>249</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>And by their conduct in this matter, abbots, in the Norman period,
were largely judged. But this has been a slight digression.</p>

<p>Now that I have shown that in monastic chronicles we have the
complement and corroboration of the words of Matthew Paris, I
propose to quote as a climax to my argument the writ printed below.
Startling as it may read, for its early date, to the holders of the
accepted view, the vigour of its language convinced me, when I
found it, that in it King William speaks; nor was there anything to
be gained by forging a document which admits, by placing on
record, the abbey's full liability.<a id="footnotetagks250" name="footnotetagks250"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks250"><sup>250</sup></a></p>

<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>Being addressed to &AElig;thelwig, the writ, of course, must be previous
to his death in 1077, but I think that we can date it, perhaps, with
precision, and that it belongs to the year 1072. In that year, says the
Ely chronicler, the Conqueror, projecting his invasion to Scotland,
'jusserat tam abbatibus quam episcopis totius Angliae debita militiae
obsequia transmitti', a phrase which applies exactly to the writ before
us. In that year, moreover, the movements of William fit in
fairly with the date for which the feudal levy was here summoned.
We know that he visited Normandy in the spring, and invaded Scotland
in the summer, and he might well summon his baronage to
meet him on June 3rd, on his way from Normandy to Scotland, at
so convenient a point as Clarendon. The writ, again, being witnessed
at Winchester, may well have been issued by the king on his way
out or back.</p>

<p>The direction to the abbot to summon similarly all those beneath
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[pg 239]</span>
his sway who owed military service is probably explained by the
special position he occupied as 'chief ruler of several counties at the
time'.<a id="footnotetagks252" name="footnotetagks252"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks252"><sup>252</sup></a>
We find him again, two years later (1074), acting as a
military commander. On that occasion the line of the Severn was
guarded against the rebel advance by Bishop Wulfstan, 'cum
magna militari manu, et &AElig;gelwius Eoveshamnensis abbas cum suis,
ascitis sibi in adjutorium Ursone vicecomite Wigorniae et Waltero de
Laceio cum copiis suis, et cetera multitudine plebis'.<a id="footnotetagks253" name="footnotetagks253"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks253"><sup>253</sup></a>
The number of knights which constituted the <cite>servitium debitum</cite> of Evesham was
five then as it was afterwards, and this number, as we now know,
had been fixed <i>pro voluntate sua</i>, in 1070, by the Conqueror.</p>

<p>We find allusions to two occasions on which the feudal host was
summoned, as above, by the Conqueror, and by his sons and
successors. William Rufus exacted the full <cite>servitium debitum</cite> to repress
the revolt at the commencement of his reign.<a id="footnotetagks254" name="footnotetagks254"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks254"><sup>254</sup></a>
Henry I called out the host to meet the invasion of his brother Robert.<a id="footnotetagks255" name="footnotetagks255"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks255"><sup>255</sup></a> In both these
instances reference is made to the questions of 'service due' that
would naturally arise,<a id="footnotetagks256" name="footnotetagks256"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks256"><sup>256</sup></a>
and that would keep the <i>quotas</i> of knight
service well to the front. That these <i>quotas</i>, however, as I said
(<i>supra</i>, p. 205), were matter of memory rather than of record, is
shown by a pair of early disputes.<a id="footnotetagks257" name="footnotetagks257"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks257"><sup>257</sup></a></p>

<p>Let us pass, at this point, to the great survey. I urged in the
earlier portion of this paper that the argument from the silence of
Domesday is of no value. Even independently of direct allusions,
whether to the case of individual holders, or to whole groups such as
the <i>milites</i> of Lanfranc, it can be shown conclusively that the
normal <i>formulae</i> cover unquestionable military tenure, tenure by
knight service.<a id="footnotetagks258" name="footnotetagks258"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks258"><sup>258</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[pg 240]</span></p>

<p>An excellent instance is afforded in the case of Abingdon Abbey
(fol. 258<i>b</i>-9<i>b</i>), because the <cite>formulae</cite> are quite normal and make
'no record of any new duties or services of any kind'.<a id="footnotetagks259" name="footnotetagks259"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks259"><sup>259</sup></a>
Yet we are able to identify the tenants named in Domesday, right and left, with
the foreign knights enfeoffed by Athelelm to hold by military
tenure,<a id="footnotetagks260" name="footnotetagks260"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks260"><sup>260</sup></a>
owing service for their fees 'to Lord as Lord'. There are
some specially convincing cases, such as those of Hubert, who held
five hides in a hamlet of Cumnor,<a id="footnotetagks261" name="footnotetagks261"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks261"><sup>261</sup></a>
and whose fee is not only
entered in the list of knights:<a id="footnotetagks262" name="footnotetagks262"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks262"><sup>262</sup></a>
but is recorded to have been given
before Domesday for military service.<a id="footnotetagks263" name="footnotetagks263"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks263"><sup>263</sup></a>
Another case is that of
William <i>camerarius</i>, who held Lea by the service of one knight;<a id="footnotetagks264" name="footnotetagks264"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks264"><sup>264</sup></a>
so too with the Bishop of Worcester's Manor of Westbury-on-Trym,
where the <i>homines</i> of Domesday appear as <i>milites</i> in a rather
earlier survey.<a id="footnotetagks265" name="footnotetagks265"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks265"><sup>265</sup></a></p>

<p>Again, take the case of Peterborough. The Northamptonshire
possessions of that house are divided by Domesday (fol. 221) into
two sections, of which the latter is headed 'Terra hominum ejusdem
ecclesiae', and represents the sub-infeudated portion, just as the
preceding section contains the <i>dominium</i> of the fief.<a id="footnotetagks266" name="footnotetagks266"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks266"><sup>266</sup></a>
Here 'Terra
hominum ejusdem' corresponds with the heading 'Terra militum
ejus' prefixed to the knights of the Archbishop of Canterbury (fol. 4).
The Peterborough <i>homines</i> are frequently spoken of as <i>milites</i> (fol.
221<i>b</i>, <i>passim</i>), and even where we only find such <i>formulae</i> as 'Anschitillus
tenet de abbate' we are able to identify the tenant as Anschetil
de St Medard, one of the foreign knights enfeoffed by Abbot
Turold.<a id="footnotetagks267" name="footnotetagks267"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks267"><sup>267</sup></a></p>

<p>But it is not only on church fiefs that the Domesday under-tenant
proves to be a feudal <i>miles</i>. At Swaffham (Cambridgeshire)
we read in Domesday (fol. 196) 'tenet Hugo de Walterio [Gifard]'.<a id="footnotetagks268" name="footnotetagks268"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks268"><sup>268</sup></a>
Yet in the earlier record of a <cite>placitum</cite> on the rights of Ely, we find
this tenant occurring as '<i>Hugo de bolebec</i> miles <i>Walteri Giffard</i>',
while in 1166 his descendant and namesake is returned as the chief
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[pg 241]</span>
tenant on the Giffard fief. The same <cite>placitum</cite> supplies other illustrations
of the fact.<a id="footnotetagks269" name="footnotetagks269"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks269"><sup>269</sup></a>
The cases taken from the Percy fief and from the
honour of Britanny afford further confirmation, if needed, of the
conclusions I draw.<a id="footnotetagks270" name="footnotetagks270"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks270"><sup>270</sup></a></p>

<p>It will startle the reader, doubtless, to learn that there is in
existence so curious a document as a list of knights' fees drawn up in
Old English. Headed 'these beth thare Knystene londes', etc., and
terming a knight's fee a 'knystesmetehom', it has been placed by the
Editors of the new <cite>Monasticon</cite> (ii. 477) among documents of the
Anglo-Saxon era, but belongs, I think (from internal evidence),
to about the same period as the <cite>cartae</cite> (1166). The original is extant
in a Cartulary now in the British Museum.</p>

<h4>VII. THE WORCESTER RELIEF (1095)<a name="page241a" id="page241a"></a></h4>

<p>It was urged in the earlier part of this paper that Ranulf Flambard
had been assigned a quite unwarrantable share in the development
of feudalism in England. But so little is actually known of what his
measures were that they have hitherto largely remained matter of
inference and conjecture. It may be well, therefore, to call attention
to a record which shows him actually at work, and which illustrates
the character of his exactions by a singularly perfect example.</p>

<p>The remarkable document that I am about to discuss is printed in
Heming's 'Cartulary' (i. 79-80).<a id="footnotetagks271" name="footnotetagks271"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks271"><sup>271</sup></a>
It is therefore most singular
that it should be unknown to Mr Freeman&mdash;to whom it would have
been invaluable for his account of Ranulf's doings&mdash;as it occurs in
the midst of a group of documents which he had specially studied for
his <i>excursus</i> on 'the condition of Worcestershire under William'.<a id="footnotetagks272" name="footnotetagks272"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks272"><sup>272</sup></a>
It is a writ of William Rufus, addressed to the tenants of the See of
Worcester on the death of Bishop Wulfstan, directing them to pay a
'relief' in consequence of that death, and specifying the quota due
from each of the tenants named. The date is fortunately beyond
question; for the writ must have been issued very shortly after the
death of Wulfstan (January 18, 1095), and in any case before
the death of Bishop Robert of Hereford (June 26, 1095), who is
one of the tenants addressed in it. As the record is not long, and
practically, as we have seen, unknown, one need not hesitate to
reprint it.</p>

<p>The points on which this document throws fresh light are these.
First, and above all, the exaction of reliefs by William Rufus and his
minister, which formed so bitter a grievance at the time, and to
which, consequently, Dr Stubbs and Mr Freeman had devoted
special attention. On this we have here evidence which is at present
unique. It must therefore be studied in some detail.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, we now learn how 'the analogy of lay fiefs was
applied to the churches with as much minuteness as possible'.<a id="footnotetagks277" name="footnotetagks277"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks277"><sup>277</sup></a>
One of the respects in which the church fiefs differed from those of
the lay barons was, that on the one hand they escaped such claims as
reliefs, wardships and 'marriage', while, on the other, their tenants,
of course also escaped payment of such 'aids' as those 'ad filium
militem faciendum' or 'ad filiam maritandam'. In this there was a
fair 'give and take'. But Ranulf must have argued that bishops and
abbots who took reliefs from their tenants ought, in like manner, to
pay reliefs to the crown. This they obviously would not do; and,
indeed, even had they been willing, it would have savoured too
strongly of simony. And so he adopted, as our record shows, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>[pg 243]</span>
unwarrantable device of extorting the relief from the under-tenants
direct. This was not an enforcement, but a breach, of feudal
principles; for an under-tenant was, obviously, only liable to relief
on his succession to his own fee.<a id="footnotetagks278" name="footnotetagks278"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks278"><sup>278</sup></a></p>

<p>It would be easy to assume that this was the abuse renounced by
Henry I.<a id="footnotetagks279" name="footnotetagks279"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks279"><sup>279</sup></a>
But <i>distinguo</i>. The above abuse was quite distinct from
the practice of annexing to the revenues of the crown, during a
vacancy, the temporalities. This, which was undoubtedly renounced
by Henry, and as undoubtedly resorted to by himself and
by his successors afterwards, was, however distasteful to the church,<a id="footnotetagks280" name="footnotetagks280"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks280"><sup>280</sup></a>
a logical deduction from feudal principles, and did not actually
wrong any individual. It could thus be retained when the crown
abandoned such unjust exactions as the Worcester relief, and
it afforded an excellent substitute for wardship, though practically
mischievous in the impulse it gave to the prolongation of
vacancies.</p>

<p class="spaceabove">There are many other points suggested by the record I am discussing,
but they can only be touched on briefly. It gives us a singularly
early use of the remarkable term 'honour', here employed in its
simplest and strictly accurate sense; the same term was similarly employed,
we have seen, in the case of Abingdon (1097), where we also
find the fief described as reverting to the crown <i>vacante sede</i>.<a id="footnotetagks281" name="footnotetagks281"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks281"><sup>281</sup></a>
It further alludes to a special assessment by 'barons' deputed for the
purpose; it affords a noteworthy formula for distraint in case of non-payment;
and it gives us, within barely nine years of the great survey
itself, a list of the tenants of the fee, which should prove of peculiar
value.</p>

<p>If the sums entered be added up, their total will amount to exactly
&pound;250. It is tempting to connect this figure with a <cite>servitium debitum</cite>
(<cite>teste episcopo</cite>) of fifty fees at the 'ancient relief' of &pound;5 a fee; but we
are only justified in treating it as one of those round sums that we
find exacted for relief under Henry II, especially as its items cannot
be connected with the actual knights' fees. The appended analysis
will show the relation (where ascertainable) of sums paid to hides
held.</p>

<p>The comparison of these two lists suggests some interesting
conclusions. Roger de Laci, forfeited early in the reign for treason,
had been succeeded by his brother Hugh. 'Punher' supplies us with
the transitional form from the 'Ponther' of Domesday to the 'Puher'
of the reign of Henry I. The identity of the names is thus established.
Walter fitz Roger has already assumed his family surname as Walter
de Gloucester, and his uncle Durand has now been succeeded by a
son Roger, whose existence was unknown to genealogists. The
pedigree of the family in the Norman period has been well traced
by Mr A. S. Ellis in his paper on the Gloucestershire Domesday
tenants, but he was of opinion that Walter de Gloucester was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>[pg 245]</span>
immediate successor in the shrievalty of his uncle, Durand, who died
without issue. This list, on the contrary, suggests that the immediate
successor of Durand was his son Roger, and that if, like his father,
he held the shrievalty, this might account for the interlineation
remitting, in his case, the sum due. In this Roger we, surely, have
that 'Roger de Gloucester' who was slain in Normandy in 1106,
and whom, without the evidence afforded by this list, it was not
possible to identify.<a id="footnotetagks282" name="footnotetagks282"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnoteks282"><sup>282</sup></a></p>

<p>The chief difficulty that this list presents is its omission of the
principal tenant of the see, Urse d'Abetot. One can only assign it
to the fact of his official position as sheriff enabling him to secure
exemption for himself, and perhaps even for his brother, Robert
'Dispensator'. Their exemption, however accounted for, involved an
arbitrary assessment of all the remaining tenants, irrespective of the
character or of the extent of their tenure. With these remarks I
must leave a document, which is free from anachronism or inconsistency,
and as trustworthy, I think, as it is useful.</p>

<p>It is my hope that this paper may increase the interest in the
forthcoming edition of the <cite>Liber Rubeus</cite> under the care of Mr
Hubert Hall, and that it may lead to a reconsideration of the
problems presented by the feudal system as it meets us in England.
Nor can I close without reminding the reader that if my researches
have compelled me to differ from an authority so supreme as Dr
Stubbs, this in no way impugns the soundness of his judgment on
the <i>data</i> hitherto known. The original sources have remained so
strangely neglected, that it was not in the power of any writer covering
so wide a field to master the facts and figures which I have now
endeavoured to set forth, and on which alone it is possible to form a
conclusion beyond dispute.</p>

Palgrave, as Mr Freeman observes, 'strongly and clearly brought out the
absence of any distinct mention of military tenures in Domesday'. Dr Stubbs
more cautiously wrote: 'The wording of the Domesday Survey does not imply
that in this respect the new military service differed from the old.' (<cite>servitia</cite>, i. 262.)
Mr Freeman confidently asserts: 'Nothing is more certain than that from one end
of Domesday to the other, there is not a trace of military tenures as they were
afterwards understood.... We hear of nothing in Domesday which can be called
knight-service or military tenure in the later sense.' (<cite>N.C.</cite>, v. 370, 371.) Mr Hunt
(<cite>Norman Britain</cite>) follows the same line, and Gneist, vouching Palgrave, Stubbs, and
Freeman, repeats the argument. (<cite>servitia</cite>, i. 130.)</p>

As so much stress has been laid on the argument from Domesday, it is desirable
further to demonstrate its worthlessness by referring to the Lindsey Survey (<i>vide
supra</i>, p. 149). This survey can only be a few years previous to 1120, and was
therefore made at a time when, <i>ex hypothesi</i>, feudal tenures had been established
for some time. Yet here, also, page after page may be searched in vain for any
mention of 'knights' or 'fees'.</p>

that the complete following out of the Frank idea [exact proportion of service to
hides] was reserved for Henry II, unless his military reforms are to be understood,
as so many of his other measures are, as the revival and strengthening of
anti-feudal and pre-feudal custom'. (<cite>Ibid.</cite>) The allusion is, clearly, to the assize
of arms; but was that assize based on fixed quantities of land? Mr Little has discussed

quia dominus Rex praecepit michi mandare quot milites habeo et eorum nomina,

Compare the case of the Irish bishops six years later (1172), who sent the king
'litteras suas in modum cartae extra sigillum pendentes' (Howden). Note also that
the addition of the seal made the return essentially a <cite>carta</cite>. In Normandy, the
tenants by knight-service were only required (1172) to seal the return (<i>breve</i>) of
their <cite>servitium debitum</cite>.</p>

The point is of some importance in its bearing on the right of the individual to
assess himself, which is held in this case to have been exercised. 'The assessment,'
writes Dr Stubbs, 'of the individual depended very much on his own report, which
the exchequer had little means of checking.'&mdash;<cite>servitia</cite>, i. 585.</p>

By one of those slips so marvellously rare in his writings Dr Stubbs writes
that 'the Bishop of Durham's service for his demesne land was that of ten knights,

service for his demesne, because there were already over seventy fees created on his
fief, though he only owed ten.</p>

'Episcopus Exoniensis tenet de Domino Rege de Capellaria de Boseham vii.

I have found a case bearing upon this point and reported at great length
(Thorpe's <cite>Registrum Roffense</cite>, pp. 70 <i>et seq.</i>). It arose from an attempt of the
Archbishop of Canterbury, in 1253, to distrain the Bishop of Rochester for the
'auxilium ad filium regis primogenitum militem faciendum'. The bishop 'posuit
se super recordum rotulorum de Scaccario, per quos rotulos poterit et illa quam
rex contra episcopum et etiam illa quam archiepiscopus contra episcopum movit
questio diffiniri. Didicerat enim episcopus per unum fidelem amicum quem in

episcopatus aliquod fuit regi factum servicium vel datum scutagium.... Unde
consulebat quod audaciter poneret se episcopus super recordum rotulorum de
Scaccario, nichil enim tenet episcopus per baroniam de rege, sed per puram

nisi dumtaxat de Karleolen. Cumque cum audacia institisset episcopus,

tempore primi conquestus' (?) and reported: 'nusquam invenerunt episcopum
Roffensem solvisse aut dedisse aliquod servicium regibus temporale'. But the
dispute was not finally decided till 1259. The clue to the matter is found in the
Canterbury 'Domesday Monachorum' (8th Report Hist. MSS. i. 316), where a
list of the archbishop's knights, perhaps coeval with Domesday (<cite>vide infra</cite>, p. 236),
is headed by 'Episcopus Roffensis' with a <cite>servitium</cite> of ten knights to the Primate.</p>

<cite>Ibid.</cite> It is impossible, within the compass of a note, to discuss the two consecutive
and most important entries on the Roll (pp. 37-8), which represent a
payment by the Earl of Chester on 20 fees, 'pro feodo Turoldi vicecomitis', and by
Richard de Camville on 40 fees, 'pro feodo Willelmi de Romara'. I called attention
to the former entry in the <cite>Academy</cite> (April 21, 1888), but did not at that time
explain it. Mr R. E. G. Kirk undertook to explain 'its real meaning' (<cite>Genealogist</cite>,
v. 141), which, however, he completely mistook (<cite>Ibid.</cite>, July 1891). The two entries, I
think, should be read together as relating to the estates of the famous Lucy, the
common ancestress of the earl and of William. If so, they may refer to a fief with
an original <cite>servitium</cite> of 60 knights, of which one-third was in the hands of the
Earl of Chester, and two-thirds in that of his cousin. Independently of the light
they throw on the obscure history of this divided and contested fief, they are of
value for the unique reference (in this Roll) to 'noviter feffati' (<cite>vide infra</cite>). The total
(including these) for the two fiefs is 66<small><sup>31</sup></small>&frasl;<small>80</small>. There is no return for the earl's Lindsey
fief in 1166, but William de Roumare's return acknowledges 57 fees. If to these
we add the 9&frac12; fees which, it says, had formerly existed in addition, we obtain 66&frac12;.
This suggests that the one fief of 1166 represents the two of 1165. It should be
added that the Hampshire fief of William de Roumare is paid for as 20 fees in
1159 and 1162, and was similarly accounted for by Richard de Camville in both
these years.</p>

This is a very difficult case. Walter's <cite>carta</cite> might easily be read as implying a

careful scrutiny reveals that the words 'hos iiij<sup>or.</sup> milites qui has predictas terras

preceding, or (which is more probable) to the four knights who held his

case, be 30.</p>

These charters have an independent value for the light they throw, in
conjunction with the roll, on the movements of the king. The roll itself alludes to the
occasion on which the king crossed from Eling&mdash;'ex q[uo] rex mare transivit de
Eilling[es]'&mdash;and as it is assigned to Michaelmas, 1130, the entry cannot refer to
his departure at that very date, especially as these charters are not paid for
among the <i>nova</i> proceedings of the year. They must therefore have been granted at
his previous departure (August 1127), when he must have crossed from Eling and
have gone to S. Pierre sur Dive (and Argentan) in Normandy. Pleas were heard
before him at Eling on this occasion (<cite>Rot. Pip.</cite>, pp. 17, 38), and are referred to in a

It is singular that in his admirable work, <cite>The English Village Community</cite>, pp.
38-9, Mr Seebohm connects 'the normal acreage of the hide of 120 a., and of the
virgate of 30 a., with the scutage of 40s per knight's fee', and argues that 'in
choosing the acreage of the standard hide and virgate, a number of acres was
probably assumed corresponding with the monetary system, so that the number of
pence in the <i>scutum</i> should correspond with the number of acres assessed to its
payment'. It need hardly be observed that the institution of scutage was, on the
contrary, long posterior to that of a hide of 120 acres.</p>

The force for the Welsh campaign was raised, as we learn from Robert de
Monte (<i>alias</i> de Torigni), 'by demanding that every three knights should, instead
of serving in person, equip one of their number', as Dr Stubbs rightly puts it
(<cite>Const. Hist.</cite>, i. 589), and not, as he elsewhere writes (preface to <cite>Gesta Henrici
Regis</cite>, II. xciv.), by requiring every two to add to themselves a third, 'by which
means, if we are to understand it literally, 90,000 knights would appear from
60,000 knights' fees'. The real number would probably be under 2,000.</p>

has been raised about the words in italics. It is argued in Alford's <cite>Abbots of Tavistock</cite>

Geoffrey's day, there was perhaps a second abbot of that name to whom that
charter refers. But he is only introduced by Mr Alford under protest; and we see
now that there is no need for him. Henry's charter being witnessed by Ralph,
Archbishop of Canterbury, William, the King's son, and the Count of Meulan,
at Odiham, belongs, I may observe to 1114-16.</p>

HISTORICAL STUDIES</h2>

<hr />

<h3>NORMANS UNDER EDWARD THE CONFESSOR</h3><!-- nec -->

<p>It is probable that in spite of all the efforts of that school which
found in Mr Freeman its ablest and most ardent leader, the 'fatal
habit', as he termed it at the outset of his <i>magnum opus</i> 'of beginning
the study of English history with the Norman Conquest itself', will
continue, in practice, to prevail among those who have a choice in
the matter. It was characteristic of the late Professor to assign the
tendency he deplored to 'a confused and unhappy nomenclature', for
to him names, as I have elsewhere shown,<a id="footnotetagnec1" name="footnotetagnec1"></a><a href="#footnotenec1"><sup>1</sup></a> were always of more importance
than they are to the world at large. More to the point is the
explanation given by Mr Grant Allen, who attributes to the unfamiliar
look of Anglo-Saxon appellatives the lack of interest shown in
those who bore them. And yet there must be, surely, a deeper cause
than this, an instinctive feeling that in England our consecutive
political history does, in a sense, begin with the Norman Conquest.
On the one hand it gave us, suddenly, a strong, purposeful monarchy;
on the other it brought us men ready to record history, and to give
us&mdash;treason though it be to say so&mdash;something better than the
arid entries in our jejune native chronicle. We thus exchange aimless
struggles, told in an uninviting fashion, for a great issue and a
definite policy, on which we have at our disposal materials deserving
of study. From the moment of the Conqueror's landing we
trace a continuous history, and one that we can really work at in
the light of chronicles and records. I begin these studies, therefore,
with the Conquest, or rather with the coming of the Normans. For,
as Mr Freeman rightly insisted, it is with the reign of Edward the
Confessor that 'the Norman Conquest really begins':<a id="footnotetagnec2" name="footnotetagnec2"></a><a href="#footnotenec2"><sup>2</sup></a> it was 'his
accession' that marked, in its results, 'the first stage of the Conquest
itself'.<a id="footnotetagnec3" name="footnotetagnec3"></a><a href="#footnotenec3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>[pg 248]</span></p>

<p>As he, elsewhere, justly observed of Edward:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Normandy was ever the land of his affection.... His heart was French.
His delight was to surround himself with companions who came from the
beloved land, and who spoke the beloved tongue, to enrich them with
English estates, to invest them with the highest offices of the English kingdom....
His real affections were lavished on the Norman priests and gentlemen
who flocked to his court as to the land of promise. These strangers were
placed in important offices about the royal person, and before long they
were set to rule as Earls and Bishops over the already half conquered soil of
England.... These were again only the first instalment of the larger gang
who were to win for themselves a more lasting settlement four and twenty
years later. In all this the seeds of the Conquest were sowing, or rather ...
it is now that the Conquest actually begins. The reign of Edward is a period
of struggle between natives and foreigners for dominion in England.<a id="footnotetagnec4" name="footnotetagnec4"></a><a href="#footnotenec4"><sup>4</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>One has, it is true, always to remember that if Edward, on his
mother's side, was a Norman, so was Harold, as his name reminds us,
on his mother's side, a Dane. Nor is it without significance that, on
the exile of his house (1051), he fled to the Scandinavian settlers on
the Irish coast, and found, no doubt, among them those who shared
his almost piratical return in 1052.<a id="footnotetagnec5" name="footnotetagnec5"></a><a href="#footnotenec5"><sup>5</sup></a> The late Professor's bias
against all that was 'French', together with his love for the 'kindred'
lands of Germany and Scandinavia, led him, perhaps, to obscure
the fact that England was a prey which the Dane was as eager
to grasp as the Norman. But this in no way impugns the truth
of his view that 'the Norman tendencies of Edward' paved the
way for the coming of William. Nor can we hesitate to begin the
study of the Norman Conquest with the coming of those, its true
forerunners&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem width15">  <div class="stanza">
<p>'Ke Ewart i aveit men&eacute;z</p>
<p>Et granz chastels &egrave; fieux dunez,'</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>and with whom may be said to have begun the story of Feudal
England.</p>

<p>Professor Burrows is entitled to the credit of setting forth the
theory, in his little book upon the Cinque Ports,<a id="footnotetagnec6" name="footnotetagnec6"></a><a href="#footnotenec6"><sup>6</sup></a> that Edward the
Confessor 'had evidently intended to make the little group of
Sussex towns, the "New Burgh" [? afterwards Hastings], Winchelsea,
and Rye, a strong link of communication between England and
Normandy', by placing them under the control of F&eacute;camp Abbey.
He holds, indeed, that Godwine and Harold had contrived to
thwart this intention in the case of the latter; but this, as I shall show
in my paper on the Cinque Ports, arises from a misapprehension.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>[pg 249]</span>
This theory I propose to develop by adding the case of Steyning,
Edward's grant of which to F&eacute;camp is well known, and has been
discussed by Mr Freeman. It might not, possibly, occur to any one
that Steyning, like Arundel, was at that time a port. But in a very
curious record of 1103, narrating the agreement made between the
Abbot and De Braose, the Lord of Bramber, it is mentioned that
ships, in the days of the Confessor, used to come up to the 'portus S.
Cuthmanni' [the patron saint of Steyning], but had been lately impeded
by a bridge that had been erected at Bramber. Here then was
another Sussex port placed in Norman hands. Yet this does not
exhaust the list. Mr Freeman seems to have strangely overlooked the
fact that the great benefice of Bosham, valued under the Confessor at
&pound;300 a year, had been conferred by Edward on his Norman chaplain,
Osbern, afterwards (1073) Bishop of Exeter, whose brother, in the
words of the Regius Professor, was the 'Duke's earliest and dearest
friend', and who, of course, was of kin both to William and to
Edward. Now this Bosham, with Thorney Island, commanded a
third Sussex harbour, Chichester haven.<a id="footnotetagnec7" name="footnotetagnec7"></a><a href="#footnotenec7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>But at London itself also we find the Normans favoured. The very
interesting charter of Henry II, granted by him, as Duke of the
Normans, in 1150 or 1151, to the citizens of Rouen, confirms
them in possession of their port at Dowgate, as they had held it from
the days of Edward the Confessor.<a id="footnotetagnec8" name="footnotetagnec8"></a><a href="#footnotenec8"><sup>8</sup></a> Here then we have evidence&mdash;which
seems to have eluded the research of our historians, both
general and local&mdash;that, even before the Conquest, the citizens of
Rouen had a haven of their own at the mouth of the Walbrook,
for which they were probably indebted to the Norman proclivities
of the Confessor.</p>

<p>The building of 'Richard's Castle' plays a most important part
in Mr Freeman's narrative of the doings of the Normans under
Edward the Confessor. We hear of its building, according to him,
in September 1051:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Just at this moment another instance of the insolence and violence of the
foreigners in another part of the kingdom served to stir up men's minds to
the highest pitch. Among the Frenchmen who had flocked to the land of
promise was one named Richard the son of Scrob, who had received a grant
of lands in Herefordshire. He and his son Osbern had there built a castle on
a spot which, by a singularly lasting tradition, preserves to this day the
memory of himself and his building. The fortress itself has vanished, but its
site is still to be marked, and the name of Richard's castle, still borne by the
parish in which it stood, is an abiding witness of the deep impression which
its erection made on the minds of the men of those times.... Here then was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[pg 250]</span>
another wrong, a wrong perhaps hardly second to the wrong which had been
done at Dover. Alike in Kent and Herefordshire, men had felt the sort of
treatment which they were to expect if the King's foreign favourites were to
be any longer tolerated.<a id="footnotetagnec9" name="footnotetagnec9"></a><a href="#footnotenec9"><sup>9</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Accordingly, Godwine, Mr Freeman wrote, demanded (September
8, 1051) 'the surrender of Eustace and his men and of the
Frenchmen of Richard's Castle'. In a footnote to this statement,
he explained that '"the castle" [of the Chronicle] undoubtedly
means Richard's Castle, as it must mean in the entry of the next
year in the same Chronicle'.<a id="footnotetagnec10" name="footnotetagnec10"></a><a href="#footnotenec10"><sup>10</sup></a> Of the entry in question (1052) he
wrote: '"The castle" is doubtless Richard's Castle.... Here again
the expressions witness to the deep feeling awakened by the building
of this castle.'<a id="footnotetagnec11" name="footnotetagnec11"></a><a href="#footnotenec11"><sup>11</sup></a> So, too, in a special appendix we read:</p>

<blockquote><p>
A speaking witness to the impression which had been made on men's
minds by the building of this particular Richard's Castle, probably the
first of its class in England, is given by its being spoken of distinctively as
'the castle' even by the Worcester chronicler (1052; see p. 309), who had
not spoken of its building in his earlier narrative.<a id="footnotetagnec12" name="footnotetagnec12"></a><a href="#footnotenec12"><sup>12</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>We have, thus far, a consistent narrative. There was in Herefordshire
one castle, built by Richard and named after him. It had been
the cause of oppression and ravage, and its surrender, as such, had
been demanded by Godwine in 1051. A year later (September
1052) Godwine triumphs; 'it was needful to punish the authors of all
the evils that had happened' (p. 333); and 'all the Frenchmen'
who had caused them were at last outlawed. But now comes the
difficulty, as Mr Freeman pointed out:</p>

<blockquote><p>
The sentence did not extend to all the men of Norman birth or of French
speech who were settled in the country. It was meant to strike none but
actual offenders. By an exception capable of indefinite and dangerous
extension, those were excepted 'whom the King liked, and who were true
to him and all his folk' (ii. 334).... We have a list of those who were thus
excepted, which contains some names which we are surprised to find there.
The exception was to apply to those only who had been true to the king
and his people. Yet among the Normans who remained we find Richard,
the son of Scrob, and among those who returned we find his son Osbern.
These two men were among the chief authors of all evil (ii. 344).
</p></blockquote>

<p>That is to say, the Lord of Richard's castle, on whose surrender and
punishment Godwine had specially insisted, was specially exempted,
as guiltless, when Godwine returned to power.<a id="footnotetagnec13" name="footnotetagnec13"></a><a href="#footnotenec13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[pg 251]</span></p>

<p>In me, at least, this discrepancy aroused grave suspicion, and I
turned to see what foundation there was for identifying the offending
garrison of 1051 with that of Richard's castle. I at once discovered
there was none whatever.</p>

<p>We have here, in short, one of those cases, characteristic, as I
think, of the late Professor's work, in which he first formed an idea,
and then, under its spell, fitted the facts to it without question.
The view, for instance, of the unique position of Richard's castle as
'<em>the</em> castle' at the time is at once rendered untenable by the fact that,
on the return of Godwine, Normans fled 'some west to Pentecostes
castle, some north to Robert's castle', in the words of the Chronicle.<a id="footnotetagnec14" name="footnotetagnec14"></a><a href="#footnotenec14"><sup>14</sup></a>
Moreover, the former belonged to Osbern, 'whose surname was
Pentecost' (<i>cognomento Pentecost</i>), who, as we learn from Florence, was
forced to surrender it and leave the country, as was also the fate of
another castellan, his comrade Hugh.<a id="footnotetagnec15" name="footnotetagnec15"></a><a href="#footnotenec15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p>It is important to observe the clear distinction between Richard,
son of Scrob, of Richard's castle, and Osbern Pentecost, of Pentecost's
castle, of whom the former was allowed to remain, while the
latter was exiled. But it is another peculiarity of Mr Freeman's
work that he was apt to confuse different individuals bearing the
same name.<a id="footnotetagnec16" name="footnotetagnec16"></a><a href="#footnotenec16"><sup>16</sup></a> In this instance, he boldly assumed that 'Pentecost, as
we gather from Florence [?] ... is the same as Osbern, the son of
Richard of Richard's castle, of whom we have already heard so
much' (ii. 329), although the latter, a well-known man, is always
distinguished as a son of his father, and never as Pentecost. And
he further assumes that 'Pentecost's castle' was identical with
Richard's castle, 'the first cause of so much evil' (<cite>Ibid.</cite>). These
identifications led him into further difficulty, because Osbern, the
son of Richard, is found afterwards holding 'both lands and offices
in Herefordshire' (ii. 345). To account for this, he further assumes as
'certain that Osbern afterwards returned' (<cite>Ibid.</cite>). This assumption led
him on to suggest that others also returned from exile, and that 'their
restoration was owing to special entreaties of the King after the
death of Godwine' (ii. 346). The whole of this history is sheer
assumption, based on confusion alone.</p>

<p>Now let us clear our minds of this confusion, and keep the two
castellans and their respective castles apart. On the one hand, we
have Richard, the son of Scrob, who was left undisturbed at his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>[pg 252]</span>
castle, and was succeeded there by his son Osbern;<a id="footnotetagnec17" name="footnotetagnec17"></a><a href="#footnotenec17"><sup>17</sup></a> on the other
hand, we have Osbern, 'whose surname was Pentecost', and who
had to surrender his castle, to which the guilty Normans had fled,
and to go into exile. Can we identify that castle? I would venture to
suggest that it was no other than that of Ewyas Harold in the south-west
corner of Herefordshire, of which Domesday tells us that Earl
William had <em>re</em>-fortified it ('hoc castellum refirmaverat'), implying
that it had existed, and been dismantled before the Conquest. It
heads, in the great survey, the possessions of Alfred of Marlborough,
and although its holder T.R.E. is not mentioned, we read of the two
Manors which follow it: 'H&aelig;c duo maneria tenuit Osbernus avunculus
Alveredi T.R.E. quando Goduinus et Heraldus erant exulati'
(i. 186). Mr Freeman, of course, assumed that this Osbern was
identical with Osbern, the son of Richard, the Domesday tenant-in-chief.
This assumption is not only baseless, but also most improbable:
for Alfred was old enough to be father-in-law to Thurstan
(Mortimer), a Domesday tenant, and would scarcely therefore be
young enough to be nephew to another Domesday tenant-in-chief. I
would suggest that his uncle was that Osbern 'Pentecost' who had to
surrender his castle and flee on the return of Godwine and Harold.
This would exactly fit in with the Domesday statement, as also with
the dismantling of Ewyas Castle.<a id="footnotetagnec18" name="footnotetagnec18"></a><a href="#footnotenec18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p>Ewyas Harold fits in also with the chronicle's mention of the
Normans fleeing 'west' to Pentecost's castle.</p>

<p>We have now seen that Richard's castle did not stand alone, and
that there is nothing to identify it with that Herefordshire castle
('&aelig;nne castel') of which the garrison had committed outrages in
1051, and which is far more likely, so far as our evidence goes, to
have been 'Pentecost's Castle'. Mr Freeman rightly called attention
to 'the firm root which the Normans had taken in Herefordshire
before 1051, which looks very much as if they had been specially
favoured in these parts' (ii. 562); and he argued from this that Earl
Ralf had probably ruled the shire between 1046 and 1050. The Earl
would naturally have introduced the foreign system of castles, as he
did the foreign fashion of fighting on horseback. Indeed, speaking of
the capture of Hereford in 1055, Mr Freeman wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>
It is an obvious conjecture that the fortress destroyed by Gruffyd was a
Norman castle raised by Ralph. A chief who was so anxious to make his
people conform to Norman ways of fighting would hardly lag behind his
neighbour at Richard's castle. He would be among the first at once to
provide himself with a dwelling-place and his capital with a defence according
to the latest continental patterns (ii. 391).
</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>[pg 253]</span></p>

<p>But if this is so, he would have built it while he ruled the shire (as
Mr Freeman believed he probably did) from 1046 to 1050, and
would, in any case, have done so on taking up its government in
1051.<a id="footnotetagnec19" name="footnotetagnec19"></a><a href="#footnotenec19"><sup>19</sup></a> Consequently he would have had a castle and garrison at
Hereford in 1052. But Mr Freeman, describing Gruffyd's raid in that
year into Herefordshire, and finding a castle mentioned, assumed
that it could only be Richard's castle,<a id="footnotetagnec20" name="footnotetagnec20"></a><a href="#footnotenec20"><sup>20</sup></a> although, a few lines before,
he had admitted the existence of other castles in the shire.<a id="footnotetagnec21" name="footnotetagnec21"></a><a href="#footnotenec21"><sup>21</sup></a> Even in
1067 he would have liked to hold that Richard's castle was the only
one in Herefordshire, but the words of the chronicle were too clear
for him.<a id="footnotetagnec22" name="footnotetagnec22"></a><a href="#footnotenec22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<p>I have endeavoured to make clear my meaning, namely, that
Mr Freeman's view that 'Richard's castle' stood alone as '<em>the</em>
castle', and that Richard and his garrison were the special offenders
under Edward the Confessor, is not only destitute of all foundations,
but at variance with the facts of the case. When we read of Herefordshire
(1067) that</p>

<blockquote><p>
The Norman colony, planted in that region by Eadward and so strangely
tolerated by Harold, was still doing its work. Osbern had been sheriff under
Edward, even when Harold was Earl of the shire, and his father Richard, the
old offender, still lived (iv. 64)&mdash;
</p></blockquote>

<p>we must remember that the conduct of Harold was only strange if
Richard, as Mr Freeman maintained, was 'the old offender'. If, as
Florence distinctly tells us, he was, on the contrary, void of offence,
Harold's conduct was in no way strange.<a id="footnotetagnec23" name="footnotetagnec23"></a><a href="#footnotenec23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>[pg 254]</span></p>

<p>Let us now turn from the Herefordshire colony, planted, I think,
not so much by King Edward as by his Earl Ralph, just as Earl
William (Fitz Osbern) planted a fresh one after the Conquest.</p>

<p>Among the Normans allowed to remain, on the triumph of
Godwine's party in 1052, Florence mentions '&AElig;lfredum regis
stratorem'. On him Mr Freeman thus comments:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Several &AElig;lfreds occur in Domesday as great landowners, &AElig;lfred of
Marlborough (Osbern's nephew) and &AElig;lfred of Spain, but it is not easy to
identify their possessions with any holder of the name in Edward's time.
The names &AElig;lfred and Edward and the female name Eadgyth seem to have
been the only English names adopted by the Normans. The two former
would naturally be given to godsons or dependants of the two Athelings
while in Normandy [<i>i.e.</i> after 1013].<a id="footnotetagnec24" name="footnotetagnec24"></a><a href="#footnotenec24"><sup>24</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>An appendix, in the first volume, devoted to &AElig;lfred the giant&mdash;who
appears in Normandy, <i>circ.</i> 1030&mdash;claims that &AElig;lfred is a
name so purely English that the presumption in favour of the
English birth of any one bearing it 'in this generation is extremely
strong',<a id="footnotetagnec25" name="footnotetagnec25"></a><a href="#footnotenec25"><sup>25</sup></a> and that it was only adopted by 'a later generation of
Normans'. Mr Freeman seems to have been unaware that in Britanny
the name of Alfred enjoyed peculiar favour. I find it there as
early as the ninth century,<a id="footnotetagnec26" name="footnotetagnec26"></a><a href="#footnotenec26"><sup>26</sup></a> while I have noted in a single cartulary
seventeen examples between 1000 and 1150. Among these are
'Alfridus frater Jutheli' (<i>ante</i> 1008) and Juthel, son of Alfred (1037).
Now, at the Conquest, 'Judhael, who from his chief seat took the
name of Judhael of Totnes, became the owner', in Mr Freeman's
words, 'of a vast estate in Devonshire, and extended his possessions
into the proper Cornwall also'. But we know from charters that this
Judhael was the son of an Alfred, and was succeeded by another
Alfred, who joined Baldwin of Redvers at Exeter in 1136.<a id="footnotetagnec27" name="footnotetagnec27"></a><a href="#footnotenec27"><sup>27</sup></a> In
the same county, as Mr Freeman reminds us, we have another
Breton tenant-in-chief, 'Alvredus Brito'. In all this I am working up
to the suggestion that the well-known Alfred of Lincoln was not, as Mr
Freeman holds, an Englishman,<a id="footnotetagnec28" name="footnotetagnec28"></a><a href="#footnotenec28"><sup>28</sup></a> but a Breton. We have not only
the overwhelming presumption against any considerable tenant-in-chief
being of English origin, but the fact that his lands were new
grants. When we add to this fact that his heir (whether son or
brother) bore the distinctively Breton name of Alan,<a id="footnotetagnec29" name="footnotetagnec29"></a><a href="#footnotenec29"><sup>29</sup></a> we may
safely conclude that Alfred was not only a foreigner but a Breton.
But the strange thing is that we do not stop there; we have a Jool
(or Johol) of Lincoln, who died in 1051<a id="footnotetagnec30" name="footnotetagnec30"></a><a href="#footnotenec30"><sup>30</sup></a> after bestowing on Ramsey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>[pg 255]</span>
Abbey its Lincolnshire fief.<a id="footnotetagnec31" name="footnotetagnec31"></a><a href="#footnotenec31"><sup>31</sup></a> Thus we have an Alfred and a Juhel
'of Lincoln', as we have an Alfred and a Juhel 'of Totnes'; and in
Juhel of Lincoln we must have a Breton settled in England under the
Confessor.</p>

<p>The name of 'Lincoln' leads me to another interesting discovery.
'Both Alfred of Lincoln and the sheriff Thorold,' Mr Freeman wrote,
'were doubtless Englishmen.'<a id="footnotetagnec32" name="footnotetagnec32"></a><a href="#footnotenec32"><sup>32</sup></a> And speaking of Abbot Turold's accession
in 1070, he observed that Turold was 'a form of the Danish
Thorold, a name still [1070] familiar in that part of England, one
which had been borne by an English sheriff'.<a id="footnotetagnec33" name="footnotetagnec33"></a><a href="#footnotenec33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<p>Now this Thorold (<i>Turoldus</i>) has been the subject of much speculation
by Mr Stapleton, Mr Freeman,<a id="footnotetagnec34" name="footnotetagnec34"></a><a href="#footnotenec34"><sup>34</sup></a> etc., in connection with
William Malet and the mysterious Countess Lucy, but the facts about
him are of the scantiest, nor, I believe, has any one succeeded in
finding him actually mentioned in the Conqueror's reign, though he
is referred to in Domesday. This, however, I have now done, lighting
upon him in a passage of considerable interest <i>per se</i>. In the 'De
miraculis sancti Eadmundi' of Herman we read that when Herfast,
Bishop of Thetford, visited Baldwin, Abbot of St Edmund's, to be
cured of an injury to his eye, the Abbot induced him to renounce
his claim to jurisdiction over the Abbey:</p>

<blockquote><p>
In sacri monasterii vestiario, pr&aelig;sentibus ejusdem loci majoris &aelig;tatis
fratribus, sed etiam accitis illuc ab abbate quibusdam regis primoribus, qui
dictante justitia in eadem villa regia tenebant placita. Quorum nomina,
quamvis auditoribus t&aelig;dio, tamen sunt ver&aelig; rationis testimonio; videlicet
Hugo de Mundford, et Rogerius cognomento Bigot, Richardus Gisleberti
comitis filius, ac cum eis <i>Lincoliensis Turoldus</i> et Hispaniensis Alveredus,
cum aliis compluribus.<a id="footnotetagnec35" name="footnotetagnec35"></a><a href="#footnotenec35"><sup>35</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>The date of this incident can be fixed with certainty as 1076-79;
and it is of great interest for its mention both of the eyre itself and of
those 'barons' who took part in it; there can be no question that
'Turoldus' was the mysterious Thorold, sheriff of Lincolnshire,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>[pg 256]</span>
taking his name from Lincoln.<a id="footnotetagnec36" name="footnotetagnec36"></a><a href="#footnotenec36"><sup>36</sup></a> He was, therefore, not 'an
English sheriff' of days before the Conquest, but a Norman&mdash;as were
his fellows&mdash;who died before Domesday.<a id="footnotetagnec37" name="footnotetagnec37"></a><a href="#footnotenec37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p>The name of William Malet, connected with that of Thorold, reminds
me of a suggestion I once made,<a id="footnotetagnec38" name="footnotetagnec38"></a><a href="#footnotenec38"><sup>38</sup></a> that he held Aulkborough
in Lincolnshire, T.R.E., 'and was, to that extent, as M. le Pr&ecirc;vost
held, "established in England previously to the Conquest"'.</p>

<p>Stapleton, whose name in such matters rightly carries great weight,
maintained that because the Manor was held in 1086 by Ivo
Tailbois, and is stated in Domesday 'to have previously belonged to
William Malet', it must have been alienated by William by a gift in
frank marriage with a daughter, who must, he held, have married
Ivo. But I pointed out, firstly, that 'it is not the practice of Domesday
to enter Manors held <i>in maritagio</i> thus', and gave an instance (i.
197) 'where we find Picot holding lands from Robert Gernon, which
lands are entered in the Gernon fief with the note: "Has terras
tenet Picot Vicecomes de Roberto Gernon in maritagio femin&aelig;
su&aelig;."' I can now, by the kindness of Dr Liebermann, add the
instance of the Mandeville fief in Surrey, where we read of 'Aultone':
'De his hidis tenet Wesman vi. hidas de Goisfrido filio comitis
Eustachii; hanc terram dedit ei Goisfridus de Mannevil cum filia
sua' (i. 36).<a id="footnotetagnec39" name="footnotetagnec39"></a><a href="#footnotenec39"><sup>39</sup></a> In addition to this argument I urged that 'in default
of any statement to the contrary, we must always infer that the two
holders named in the survey are (<i>A</i>) the holder T.R.E., (<i>B</i>) the
holder in 1086'. This would make William Malet the holder T.R.E.</p>

<p>Another 'Norman' on whom I would touch is 'Robert fitz
Wimarc', so often mentioned by Mr Freeman. I claim him too as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>[pg 257]</span>
Breton, on his mother's side at least, if Wimarc, as seems to be the
case, was his mother, for that is a distinctively Breton name. Mr
Freeman queried the Biographer's description of him as 'regis consanguineus',
when at Edward's death-bed;<a id="footnotetagnec40" name="footnotetagnec40"></a><a href="#footnotenec40"><sup>40</sup></a> but he is clearly the
'Robertus regis consanguineus' of the Waltham charter.<a id="footnotetagnec41" name="footnotetagnec41"></a><a href="#footnotenec41"><sup>41</sup></a> He was
also of kin to William.<a id="footnotetagnec42" name="footnotetagnec42"></a><a href="#footnotenec42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>

<p>The last on my list is Regenbald 'the Norman chancellor of
Edward', as Mr Freeman termed him throughout. He must have
had, I presume, some authority for doing so: but I cannot discover
that authority; and, in its absence, the name, from its form, does not
suggest a Norman origin.<a id="footnotetagnec43" name="footnotetagnec43"></a><a href="#footnotenec43"><sup>43</sup></a> Of Regenbald, however, I shall have to
speak in another paper.</p>

It may be well here to allude to a still more remarkable commission, some
twenty years later, namely in 1096, when William Rufus sent 'in quadragesima
optimates suos in Devenesiram et in Cornubiam et Exoniam, Walcalinum, videlicet,
Wyntonensem episcopum, Randulphum regalem capellanum, Willelmum
Capram, Hardinum Belnothi filium (<i>i.e.</i> Elnoth or Eadnoth; <i>see</i> Greenfield's <cite>De

This eyre cannot be generally known, for Mr T. A. Archer, in his
elaborate biography of Ranulf Flambard, does not mention it. The association of
Bishop Walkelin with Ranulf is specially interesting because they are stated to
have been left by the king next year (1097) as joint regents of the realm. The name,
I may add, of 'Willelmus filius Baldwini' among those to whom the consequent
charter is addressed (<cite>Mon. Ang.</cite>, ii. 497), is of considerable importance, because it
is clearly that of the sheriff of Devon, and is proof therefore that Baldwin the sheriff
(Baldwin, son of Count Gilbert) had left a son William, who had succeeded to his
shrievalty by 1096, and who was in turn succeeded by his brother, Richard fitz
Baldwin, sheriff under Henry I.</p>

<p>It might well be thought the height of rashness to attempt criticism,
even in detail, of Mr Freeman's narrative of the Battle of Hastings.
For its story, as his champion has well observed, is 'the centre and
the very heart of Mr Freeman's work; if he could blunder here in
the most carefully elaborated passage of his whole history he could
blunder anywhere; his reputation for accuracy would be gone almost
beyond hope of retrieving it'.<a id="footnotetagbh1" name="footnotetagbh1"></a><a href="#footnotebh1"><sup>1</sup></a> And indeed, it may fairly be described
as Mr Freeman's greatest achievement, the point where he is
strongest of all. He himself described the scene as the 'battle which is
the centre of my whole history', and reminded us that</p>

<blockquote><p>
on its historic importance I need not dwell; it is the very subject of my
history.... Looking also at the fight simply as a battle, it is one of the most
memorable in all military history.
</p></blockquote>

<p>That is the first point. The second is that in his battle pieces our
author was always at his best. Essentially a concrete historian, objective
as Macaulay in his treatment, he loved incident and action;
loved them, indeed, so well, that he could scarcely bring himself to
omit the smallest details of a skirmish:</p>

<div class="poem width15">  <div class="stanza">
<p>E ripenso le mobili</p>
<p>Tende, e i percossi valli,</p>
<p>E 'l campo dei manipoli,</p>
<p>E l'onda dei cavalli.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Precentor Venables has well described</p>

<blockquote><p>
that wonderful discourse, one of his greatest triumphs&mdash;in which, with
flashing eye and thrilling voice, he made the great fight of Senlac&mdash;as he
loved to call it, discarding the later name&mdash;which changed the fortunes of
England and made her what she is, live and move before his hearers.
</p></blockquote>

<p>My third point is that his knowledge of the subject was unrivalled.
He had visited the battlefield, he tells us, no less than five times,
accompanied by the best experts, civil and military, he could find;
he had studied every authority, and read all that had been written,
till he was absolutely master of every source of information. He had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>[pg 259]</span>
further executed for him, by officers of the Royal Engineers, an
elaborate plan of the battle based on his unwearied studies. Never was
historian more splendidly equipped.</p>

<p>Thus was prepared that 'very lucid and quite original account of
the battle', as Mr G. T. Clark describes it, which we are about to
examine; that 'detailed account of the battle' that Mr Hunt, in his
<cite>Norman Britain</cite>, describes as written 'with a rare combination of
critical exactness and epic grandeur'.</p>

<h4>THE NAME OF 'SENLAC'<a name="page259a" id="page259a"></a></h4>

<p>Before we approach the great battle, it is necessary to speak plainly
of the name which Mr Freeman gave it, the excruciating name of
'Senlac'. It is necessary, because we have here a perfect type of those
changes in nomenclature on which Mr Freeman insisted, and which
always remind one of Macaulay's words:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Mr Mitford piques himself on spelling better than any of his neighbours;
and this not only in ancient names, which he mangles in defiance both of
custom and of reason.... In such cases established usage is considered as
law by all writers except Mr Mitford ... but he proceeds on no principle
but that of being unlike the rest of the world. Every child has heard of
Linn&aelig;us; therefore Mr Mitford calls him Linn&eacute;. Rousseau is known all over
Europe as Jean Jacques; therefore Mr Mitford bestows on him the strange
appellation of John James.
</p></blockquote>

<p>None of Mr Freeman's peculiar 'notes' is more familiar than this
tendency, and none has given rise to bitterer controversy or more
popular amusement. 'Pedantry' was the charge brought against him,
and to this charge he was as keenly sensitive as was Browning to that
of 'obscurity'. Of both writers it may fairly be said that they evaded
rather than met the charge brought against them. The Regius
Professor invariably maintained that accuracy, not 'pedantry', was
his true offence. Writing, in the <cite>Fortnightly Review</cite>, on 'The Study of
History', he set forth his standing defence in these words:</p>

<blockquote><p>
I would say, as the first precept, Dare to be accurate. You will be called
a pedant for doing so, but dare to be accurate all the same.</p>

<p>He who shall venture to distinguish between two English boroughs,
between two Hadriatic islands when the authorized caterer for the public
information thinks good to confound them, must be content to bear the
terrible name of pedant, even if no worse fate still is in store for him.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Was, then, our author a mere pedant, or was this the name that
ignorance bestowed on knowledge? For an answer to this question,
'Senlac' is a test-case. 'Every child', in Macaulay's words, had heard
of the Battle of Hastings; it was known by that name 'all over
Europe' from time immemorial. Unless, therefore, that name was
wrong, it was wanton and mischievous to change it; and, even if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>[pg 260]</span>
changed, it was indefensible to substitute the name of Senlac,
unless there is proof that the battle was so styled when it was
fought.</p>

<p>As to the first of these points, the old name was in no sense wrong.
Precisely as the battle of Poitiers was fought some miles from Poitiers,
so was it with that of Hastings. Yet we all speak of the Battle of
Poitiers, although we might substitute the name of Maupertuis more
legitimately than that of Senlac. The only plea that Mr Freeman
could advance was that people were led by the old name to imagine
that the battle was fought at Hastings itself! Of those who argue in
this spirit, it was finely said by the late Mr Kerslake that</p>

<blockquote><p>
instead of lifting ignorance to competence by teaching what ought to be
known, they cut down what ought to be known to the capacity of those who
are deficient of that knowledge. Instead of making them understand the
meaning of the ancient and established word 'Anglo-Saxon', they disturb
the whole world of learning with an almost violent attempt to turn out of
use the established word, which has been thoroughly understood for ages.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The simple answer to Mr Freeman's contention is, that it is
needless to make the change in histories, because those who read
them learn that the fight was at Battle; while as to those who do not
read histories, it is obvious that such a name as 'Senlac' will in no
way lighten their darkness.</p>

<p>The change, therefore, was uncalled for. But it was not merely uncalled
for; it was also absolutely wrong. 'To the battle itself,' Mr
Freeman wrote, 'I restore its true ancient name of Senlac.' In so
doing the writer acted in the spirit of those who 'restore' our churches
and who gave that word so evil a sound in the ears of all arch&aelig;ologists,
Mr Freeman himself included. I am reminded of the protest of
the Society of Antiquaries on hearing 'with much regret that a
fifteenth-century pinnacle' at Rochester Cathedral 'is in danger of
destruction in order that a modern pinnacle, professing to represent
that which stood in the place in the twelfth century, may be set up in
its stead'. Precisely such a 'restoration' is Mr Freeman's 'Senlac'.
Professing to represent the ancient name of the battle, it is substituted
for that name which the battle has borne from the days of the
Conqueror to our own. In William of Malmesbury as in Domesday
Book we read of 'the Battle of Hastings' (<i>Bellum Hastingense</i>), and
all Mr Freeman's efforts failed admittedly to discover any record or
any writer who spoke of the Battle of Senlac (<i>Bellum Senlacium</i>) save
Orderic alone. Now Orderic wrote two generations after the battle
was fought; the name he strove to give it fell from his pen stillborn;
and the fact that this name was a fad of his own is shown by what
Mr Freeman suppressed, namely, that Orderic, in the same breath,
tells us that Battle Abbey was founded as 'c&oelig;nobium Sanct&aelig;
Trinitatis Senlac', whereas we learn from Mr Freeman himself that</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>[pg 261]</span></p>

<blockquote><p>
the usual title is 'ecclesia Sancti Martini de Bello', 'ecclesia de Bello', or,
as we have seen, in English '&#254;&aelig;t mynster &aelig;t &#254;&aelig;re Bataille'. The fuller form,
'Abbas Sancti Martini de loco Belli', appears in Domesday, 11<i>b</i>: but it is
commonly called in the Survey 'ecclesia de Labatailge'.
</p></blockquote>

<p>So much for Orderic's authority.</p>

<p>So violent an innovation as this of our author's could not pass unchallenged.
Mr Frederic Harrison threw down the gauntlet
(<cite>Contemporary Review</cite>, January 1886), attacking, in a brilliant and
incisive article, Mr Freeman's 'pedantry' along the whole line. But
he chiefly complained of</p>

<blockquote><p>
a far more serious change of name that the 'Old English' school have introduced;
which, if it were indefinitely extended, would wantonly confuse
historical literature. I mean the attempt to alter names which are the
accepted landmarks of history. It is now thought scholarly to write of 'the
Battle of <em>Senlac</em>' instead of 'the Battle of <em>Hastings</em>'. As every one knows, the
fight took place on the site of Battle Abbey, seven miles from Hastings; as so
many great battles, those of Tours, Blenheim, Cann&aelig;, Chalons, and the like,
have been named from places not the actual spot of the combat.</p>

<p>But since for 800 years the historians of Europe have spoken of 'the Battle
of Hastings', it does seem a little pedantic to rename it.... The sole authority
for 'Battle of Senlac' is Orderic, a monk who lived and wrote in Normandy
in the next century. Yet, on the strength of this secondary authority, the
'Old English' school choose to erase from English literature one of our most
familiar names.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr Freeman's rejoinder must be noticed, because singularly
characteristic. Treating Mr Harrison 'de haut en bas', he expressed
surprise that his friends should expect him to reply to an article
which had merely amused him, and&mdash;unable, of course, to adduce
any fresh authority for 'Senlac'&mdash;denounced his critic for a 'reckless
raid into regions where he does not know the road'. For this charge
there was no foundation in the matter of which we treat. Mr Freeman
persisted that he had given the battle 'the only name that I
found for it anywhere' (which we have seen was not the case), and
sarcastically observed that 'so to do is certainly "pedantic", for it
conduces to accuracy'.</p>

<p>The truth is simply that the site of the battle had no name at all.
As the professor himself wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>
The spot was then quite unoccupied and untilled; nothing in any of the
narratives implies the existence of any village or settlement; our own
Chronicle only describes the site as by 'the hoar apple-tree' ('He com him
togenes &aelig;t &#254;&aelig;re haran apuldran').
</p></blockquote>

<p>Consequently, when men wished to speak of the great conflict, they
were driven, as in similar cases, to term it the Battle of Hastings, or,
if they wished to be more exact, they had to describe it, by periphrasis,
as fought on 'the site which is now called Battle'.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>[pg 262]</span></p>

<p>Henry of Huntingdon, our author tells us, is guilty, though otherwise
well informed, of 'a statement so grotesquely inaccurate as that
Harold "aciem suam construxit in <i>planis Hastinges</i>"'. Why 'grotesque'?
It would be strictly accurate to describe a battle, even seven
miles from Salisbury, as fought on Salisbury Plain; while, as to the
word 'plain', his horror of field-sports may have caused Mr Freeman's
ignorance of the fact that another such stretch of Sussex Down
is known as 'Plumpton Plain'.<a id="footnotetagbh2" name="footnotetagbh2"></a><a href="#footnotebh2"><sup>2</sup></a> But the fact is that the whole difficulty
arose from that singular narrowness that cramped our author's
mind, and that lies at the root, when rightly understood, of his most
distinctive tenets. For he was a pedant, after all. And, observe, this
'pedantry' did, in practice, conduce not to true accuracy, but to the
very reverse. Paradoxical though this may sound, it is literally true.
Let us take a striking instance. In his account of the attack on
Dover in 1067, Mr Freeman argued, 'from the distinct mention of
<i>oppidum</i> and <i>oppidani</i> in Orderic', that it was not the castle, as
supposed, but the town that was attacked. And so convinced was he
of this, that he forced his authorities into harmony with his view
against their plain meaning. This was because he was not aware that
Orderic&mdash;'my dear old friend Orderic', as in one place he terms him&mdash;was
in the habit of using <i>oppidum</i> for castle. He must have afterwards
discovered this; for his theory was tacitly and significantly
dropped, and the old version substituted, in a subsequent edition.
Again, an article on 'City and Borough', which he contributed to
<cite>Macmillan's Magazine</cite>, was based on the fundamental assumption
that <i>civitas</i>, in the Norman period, must have had a specialized
denotation. The fact that, on the contrary, the same town is spoken of
as a <i>civitas</i> and as a <i>burgus</i>, cuts the ground from under this assumption,
and, with it, destroys the whole of its elaborate superstructure.
Our author's method, in short, placed him in standing conflict
with every authority for his period. Never was 'the sacredness of
words' treated as of less account; never, indeed, were words more
wantonly changed. What would Mr Freeman have said had he
known that the compilers of that sacrosanct record, Domesday Book
itself, revelled in altering the wording of the sworn original returns?
Such was the spirit of the men whose language he strove to limit by a
terminology as precise as that of modern philosophy.</p>

<p>I may have wandered somewhat from 'Senlac', but my object
was to show that Mr Freeman misunderstood twelfth-century
writers by assigning to them his own peculiarities. It did not in
any way follow from their speaking of a 'Battle of Hastings' that they
'grotesquely' supposed it to have been fought at the town itself: they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>[pg 263]</span>
allowed themselves an elasticity, both in word and phrase, which was
so alien to himself that he could not realize its existence, and
therefore accused them of ignorance because their language was
different from his. In the same spirit he would never admit that the
'Castellum Warham' of Domesday Book was no other than Corfe
Castle, although, as Mr Eyton and Mr Bond have shown, the fact is
certain.</p>

<p>But the <i>crux</i> is yet to come. To any one acquainted with 'Old
English' it must instantly occur that 'Senlac' is not an English
name. Mr Freeman glided over this by simply ignoring the difficulty,
but was he aware that the name in question, as 'Senlecque' (or
'Senlecques'), is actually found&mdash;in France? One is reminded of
his own criticism on the name 'Duncombe Park':</p>

<blockquote><p>
When the lands of Helmsley were made to take the name of Duncombe,
a real wrong was done to geography.... How came a <i>combe</i> in Yorkshire?
The thing is a fraud on nomenclature as great as any of the frauds which the
first Duncombe, 'born to carry parcels and to sweep down a counting-house',

<p>How came a French 'Senlac' in 'Old English' Sussex? The name is
as obviously foreign as 'Senlis' itself, and the occurrence, in later
days of 'Santlach&aelig;' as a local field-name, cannot avail against this
fact, or prove that this open down, in days before the Conquest,
could have borne such a title. Therefore, when Mr Freeman
wrote that the English king 'pitched his camp upon the ever memorable
heights of Senlac', he was guilty, not only of anachronism,
but of a 'real wrong to geography', and, in the name of accuracy, he
introduced error.<a id="footnotetagbh3" name="footnotetagbh3"></a><a href="#footnotebh3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>I have gone thus carefully into this matter because the name has
been meekly adopted by historians, and even by journalists, thereby
proving the power of that tendency to fashion and imitation on
which, in his <cite>Physics and Politics</cite>, Mr Bagehot loved to insist. For my
part I make an earnest appeal to all who may write or teach history
to adhere to the 'true ancient name' of the Battle of Hastings, and
to reject henceforward an innovation which was uncalled for, misleading,
and wrong.<a id="footnotetagbh4" name="footnotetagbh4"></a><a href="#footnotebh4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>[pg 264]</span></p>

<h4>THE PALISADE</h4>

<p>The distinctive peculiarity of the English tactics, we learn from Mr
Freeman at the outset, is found in an entirely novel device introduced
on this occasion by Harold. Instead of merely forming his
troops in the immemorial array known as the shield-wall, he turned
'the battle as far as possible into the likeness of a siege',<a id="footnotetagbh5" name="footnotetagbh5"></a><a href="#footnotebh5"><sup>5</sup></a>
by building around them a 'palisade' of solid timber. How large a part this
'palisade' plays in Mr Freeman's story may be gathered from the
fact that it is mentioned at least a score of times in his account of the
great battle. This 'fortress of timber', with its 'wooden walls', had 'a
triple gate of entrance', and was composed of 'firm barricades of ash
and other timber, wattled in so close together that not a crevice
could be seen'.</p>

<p>It would be easier for me to deal with this 'palisade' if one could
form a clear idea of what it represented to Mr Freeman's mind.
Judging from the passages quoted above, and from his praising
Henry of Huntingdon for his 'admirable comparison of Harold's
camp to a castle';<a id="footnotetagbh6" name="footnotetagbh6"></a><a href="#footnotebh6"><sup>6</sup></a>
I was led to believe that he imagined precisely
such a timber wall as crowned in those days a castle mound. Such a
defence is well shown in the Bayeux Tapestry, crowning the castle
mound which William threw up at Hastings. Now, this very
parallel is suggested by Mr Freeman himself. Describing Harold's
position as 'not without reason called a fortress' [where?] he suggested
that 'its defences might be nearly equal to those of William's own
camp at Hastings' (p. 447). Following up this parallel, we find Mr
Freeman writing of this latter:</p>

<blockquote><p>
A portion of English ground was already entrenched and <i>palisaded</i>, and
changed into a Norman fortress (p. 418).... He saw the carpenters come
out with their axes; he saw the fosse dug, and the <i>palisade</i> thrown up (p. 419).
They had already built a fort and had fenced it in with a <i>palisade</i>
(p. 420).
</p></blockquote>

<p>Without binding Mr Freeman down to a defence precisely of this
character&mdash;and, indeed, in this as in other matters, he may not
even himself have formed a clear idea of what he meant&mdash;it gives
us, I think we may fairly say, a general idea of his 'palisade'. It was
certainly no mere row of stakes,<a id="footnotetagbh7" name="footnotetagbh7"></a><a href="#footnotebh7"><sup>7</sup></a>
no heap of cottage window frames,<a id="footnotetagbh8" name="footnotetagbh8"></a><a href="#footnotebh8"><sup>8</sup></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>[pg 265]</span>
no fantastic array of shields tied to sticks,<a id="footnotetagbh9" name="footnotetagbh9"></a><a href="#footnotebh9"><sup>9</sup></a> no '<i>abattis</i> of some
sort'<a id="footnotetagbh10" name="footnotetagbh10"></a><a href="#footnotebh10"><sup>10</sup></a> that Mr Freeman had in view, whatever his champions
may pretend. As for the defenders of the 'palisade', they cannot
even agree among themselves as to what it really was. Mr Archer
produces a new explanation, only to throw it over almost as soon as
it is produced.<a id="footnotetagbh11" name="footnotetagbh11"></a><a href="#footnotebh11"><sup>11</sup></a> One seeks to know for certain what one is expected
to deal with; but, so far as it is possible to learn, nobody can tell one.
There is only a succession of dissolving views, and one is left to
deal with a nebulous hypothesis.<a id="footnotetagbh12" name="footnotetagbh12"></a><a href="#footnotebh12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>Mr Freeman wrote of his 'palisade' as a mere 'development of the
usual tactics of the shield-wall'; but this is an obvious misconception.
It might, indeed, be used as a substitute for the 'shield-wall',
and would enable the troops behind it to adopt a looser
formation; but to suppose that they were ranged 'closely together in
the thick array of the shield-wall', with this second wall in front of
them, is surely absurd. Till the 'wooden walls' were broken the
'shield-wall' was needless. To retain the disadvantages of its close
order, when that order had been rendered needless, would have been
simply insane. Yet this insanity, in our author's eyes, was 'the master-skill
of Harold'. Was there time, moreover, to construct such a
fortress, if 'the battle followed almost immediately', as we learn,
'on the arrival of Harold'? Lastly, would there be material on the
spot for a palisade (see ground plan) about a mile in length?<a id="footnotetagbh13" name="footnotetagbh13"></a><a href="#footnotebh13"><sup>13</sup></a>
These awkward points may not have occurred to Mr Freeman;
but to others they will, I think, cause some uneasiness. Let us then
examine Mr Freeman's authorities for the existence of this palisade.</p>

<h4>MR FREEMAN'S AUTHORITIES FOR IT<a name="page265a" id="page265a"></a></h4>

<p>In his note on 'The Details of the Battle of Senlac' (iii. 756), Mr
Freeman explained that he had given the authorities on which his
statements rested, adding:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Each reader can therefore judge for himself how far my narrative is borne
out by my authorities.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Loyally keeping to this principle, I propose to test his statements
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>[pg 266]</span>
by the authorities he gives for them himself. I therefore address
myself to the passages in Henry of Huntingdon and in Wace.</p>

<p class="title1c">(1) <i>Henry of Huntingdon</i></p>

<p>The passage relied on by the historian is this:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Quum ergo Haroldus totam gentem suam in una acie strictissime locasset
<i>et quasi castellum inde construxisset</i><a id="footnotetagbh14" name="footnotetagbh14"></a><a href="#footnotebh14"><sup>14</sup></a> impenetrabiles erant Normannis (iii. 444,
note).
</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr Freeman thus paraphrased Henry's words:</p>

<blockquote><p>
He occupied and fortified, as thoroughly as the time and the means at
his command would allow, a post of great natural strength, which he made
into what is distinctly spoken of as a castle (<cite>Ibid.</cite>).<a id="footnotetagbh15" name="footnotetagbh15"></a><a href="#footnotebh15"><sup>15</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Although the writer made it his complaint against one of the
editors in the Rolls series that he could not 'construe his Latin',
we see that the same failing led him here himself into error. <i>Inde</i>
refers, and can only refer, to Harold's troops themselves. A fortress
Harold wrought; but he wrought it of flesh and blood: it was behind
no ramparts that the soldiers of England awaited the onset of the
chivalry of France.</p>

<p>The metaphor, of course, is a common one. Henry of Huntingdon
himself recurs to it, when describing that 'acies', at the Battle
of Lincoln, which Stephen 'circa se ... strictissime collocavit'
(p. 271), as Harold, he wrote, 'gentem suam in una acie strictissime
locasset' (p. 203). For he shows us Stephen's 'acies' assailed 'sicut
castellum'.<a id="footnotetagbh16" name="footnotetagbh16"></a><a href="#footnotebh16"><sup>16</sup></a>
In the same spirit an Irish bard tells us how his countrymen,
on the battlefield of Dysert O'Dea (May 10, 1318), closed in
their ranks, 'like a strong fortress', as their enemies surged around
them. It was felicitous, indeed, to describe as 'quasi castellum' that
immovable mass of warriors girt by their shield-wall,<a id="footnotetagbh17" name="footnotetagbh17"></a><a href="#footnotebh17"><sup>17</sup></a>
that 'fortress of shields', as Mr Freeman termed it, at Hastings itself (iii. 492),
at Stamford Bridge (iii. 372), at Maldon (i. 272), and even in
earlier days (i. 151).</p>

<p>It was Mr Freeman's initial error in thus materializing a metaphor
(through misconstruing his Latin) that first led me to doubt the
existence of the 'palisade'. His champion, Mr Archer, in his first
article,<a id="footnotetagbh18" name="footnotetagbh18"></a><a href="#footnotebh18"><sup>18</sup></a>
was ominously silent as to this error: in the second, he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>[pg 267]</span>
to confess of this passage, the first of Mr Freeman's proofs, that he
himself 'should never think of using it to prove a palisade'.<a id="footnotetagbh19" name="footnotetagbh19"></a><a href="#footnotebh19"><sup>19</sup></a>
<i>Exit</i>, therefore, Henry of Huntingdon.</p>

<p class="title1c">(2) <i>Wace</i></p>

<p>Two passages, and two alone, are in question&mdash;</p>

<p>(A) ll. 6991-4, which Mr Freeman has paraphrased thus:</p>

<table class="diff1" summary="comparison" border="0">
<tr>
      <th class="center1">
      <span class="sc">Wace</span></th>

	  with a triple gate of entrance,
	  and defended it to the south by
	  an artificial ditch (iii. 447).
	  </td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>My criticism on this has been from the first that Wace here
speaks <i>only</i> of a ditch, and that Mr Freeman has not only introduced
here the alleged palisade, from which Wace's 'fosse' was quite
distinct, but has also transferred to that palisade the 'treis entrees'
of the fosse. That Mr Freeman did treat the 'palisade' and the
'fosse' as distinct and considerably apart is proved by this passage:</p>

<blockquote><p>
The Normans had crossed the [<i>sic</i>] English fosse, and were now at the
foot of the hill with the palisades and the axes right before them (iii. 476).
</p></blockquote>

<p>The 'fosse' is that 'artificial ditch' of which Mr Freeman speaks in
the above passage, the only one of which he does speak. Therefore,
that 'artificial ditch' was, in his view, down in the valley to the
south, and had nothing to do with that 'palisade' which he placed on
the hill. There is thus no possible doubt as to Mr Freeman's view.
On his own showing, the above lines make no mention of a palisade
on the hill.<a id="footnotetagbh20" name="footnotetagbh20"></a><a href="#footnotebh20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>(B) ll. 7815-26: The passage in question runs thus:</p>

<div class="poem width15">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Fet orent devant els <i>escuz</i></p>

  </div>  </div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>[pg 268]</span></p>

<p>In his first edition, writing, I believe, under the influence of
Taylor's version, Mr Freeman gave these lines in a footnote to his
narrative of the battle, and appears to have then looked on them as
describing his palisade.<a id="footnotetagbh21" name="footnotetagbh21"></a><a href="#footnotebh21"><sup>21</sup></a> But in his 'second edition, revised', in
preparing which he went 'minutely through every line, and corrected
or improved whatever seemed to need correction or improvement'
(p. v), he transferred these lines to his appendix on the
battle, where he wrote concerning them as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>
[(At Maldon) the English stood, <i>as at Senlac</i>, in the array common to them
and their enemies&mdash;a strong line, or rather wedge, of infantry, forming a
wall with their shields (i. 271).]<a id="footnotetagbh22" name="footnotetagbh22"></a><a href="#footnotebh22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<p>Of the array of the shield-wall we have often heard already, as at Maldon
(see vol. i. p. 271), but it is at Senlac that we get the fullest descriptions of it
[<i>sic</i>] all the better for coming in the mouths of enemies. Wace gives his
description, 12941:
</p></blockquote>

<div class="poem width15"><div class="stanza">
      <p>'Fet orent devant els escuz</p>
      <p>De fenestres &egrave; d'altres fuz;</p>

      <p class="i4"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p>

</div></div>

<blockquote><p>
So William of Malmesbury, 241. 'Pedites omnes cum bipennibus, conserta
ante se scutorum testudine, impenetrabilem cuneum faciunt; quod profecto
illis e&acirc; die saluti fuisset, nisi Normanni simulat&acirc; fug&acirc; more suo confertos
manipulos laxassent.' So at the battle of the Standard, according to &AElig;thelred
of Rievaux (343), 'scutis scuta junguntur, lateribus latera conseruntur'
(iii. 763-4).
</p></blockquote>

<p>The unquestionable meaning of Mr Freeman's words is that
Wace's lines (like the other passages) describe the time-honoured
shield-wall, 'the fortress of shields, so often sung of alike in English
and in Scandinavian minstrelsy' (iii. 372).</p>

<p>Appealing to this, his own verdict, in my original article,<a id="footnotetagbh23" name="footnotetagbh23"></a><a href="#footnotebh23"><sup>23</sup></a>
I spoke of these lines as referring to the 'shield-wall', and maintained
that 'escuz' meant shields, not 'barricades'. This also, it will be seen,
must have been Mr Freeman's view, when he pronounced these
lines to be a description of the shield-wall. I therefore declared that
the only evidence he adduced for his palisade had been demonstrably
obtained by misconstruing his Latin, and (on his own showing) by
mistranslating his French.</p>

<p>This has been my case from the first: it remains my case now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>[pg 269]</span></p>

<p>Unlike our forefathers on the hill of battle, I will not be decoyed
into breaking 'the line of the shield-wall'.<a id="footnotetagbh24" name="footnotetagbh24"></a><a href="#footnotebh24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<h4>MY ARGUMENT AGAINST IT<a name="page269a" id="page269a"></a></h4>

<p>In order to show clearly that I adhere to my original position, I
need only reprint my argument as it appeared in the <i>Quarterly
Review</i>.</p>

<blockquote><p>
It is clear that if he (Mr Freeman) found it needful, in his story of the
great battle, to mention this barricade about a score of times, it must have
occupied a prominent place in every contemporary narrative. And yet we
assert without fear of contradiction that (dismissing the 'Roman de Rou') in
no chronicle or poem, among all Mr Freeman's authorities, could he find
any ground for this singular delusion; while the Bayeux Tapestry itself,
which he rightly places at their head, will be searched in vain for a palisade,
or for anything faintly resembling it, from beginning to end of the battle.<a id="footnotetagbh25" name="footnotetagbh25"></a><a href="#footnotebh25"><sup>25</sup></a>
</p>

<p class="spaceabove">On this passage we take our stand: it is the very essence of our case. We
made our statement 'without fear of contradiction'; and it is not contradicted.
Moreover, we can now further strengthen it by appealing to Baudri's
poem,<a id="footnotetagbh26" name="footnotetagbh26"></a><a href="#footnotebh26"><sup>26</sup></a>
an authority of the first rank, in which, as in the others, there is no
allusion to the existence of any 'palisade'.</p>

<p>It will be observed that, in this passage, we expressly excluded Wace's
poem. We did so because&mdash;although, as we have seen, Mr Freeman failed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>[pg 270]</span>
produce from it any proof of a palisade&mdash;we preferred to leave it an open
question whether Wace did or did not believe the English to have fought
behind a palisade. In rebutting Mr Freeman's evidence, that question did
not arise.</p>

<p>There is another argument that we refrained from bringing forward
because we thought it superfluous. The Normans, of course, as Mr Freeman
reminds us, magnified the odds against them: 'Nothing but the special
favour of God could have given his servants a victory over their enemies,
which was truly miraculous' (p. 440). William of Poitiers, he adds (p. 479),
sets forth their difficulties in detail:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Angli nimium adjuvantur superioris loci opportunitate, quem sine
procursu tenent, et maxime conferti; atque ingenti quoque numerositate
su&acirc; atque validissim&acirc; corpulenti&acirc;; pr&aelig;terea pugn&aelig; instrumentis, qu&aelig; facile
per scuta vel alia tegmina viam inveniunt.'</p>

<p>Now William who was not only a contemporary writer, but, says Mr
Freeman (p. 757), 'understood' the site, had, obviously, every inducement
to include, among the difficulties of the Normans, that special 'development',
which according to Mr Freeman (pp. 444, 468), 'the foresight of Harold' had
introduced on this occasion, and which, he assures us, involved 'a frightful
slaughter' of the Normans. And yet this writer is absolutely silent, both here
and throughout the battle, as to the existence of a barricade of any sort or
kind.<a id="footnotetagbh27" name="footnotetagbh27"></a><a href="#footnotebh27"><sup>27</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Here I would briefly refer to certain misrepresentations. Mr
Archer claimed, in his original article (<cite>Cont. Rev.</cite>, 344) to 'mainly
rely' upon Wace, on the ground that I did so myself. I was obliged to
describe this statement at once as 'the exact converse of the truth'.<a id="footnotetagbh28" name="footnotetagbh28"></a><a href="#footnotebh28"><sup>28</sup></a>
For it will be seen, I expressly excluded Wace from the authorities on
whom I relied, and specially rested my case, from the first, on the
evidence of the Bayeux Tapestry. It is much to be regretted that Mr
Archer has deliberately repeated his statement,<a id="footnotetagbh29" name="footnotetagbh29"></a><a href="#footnotebh29"><sup>29</sup></a>
though even his ally reluctantly admits that it was 'not very happily worded'.<a id="footnotetagbh30" name="footnotetagbh30"></a><a href="#footnotebh30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

<p>Mr Archer might well seek to avoid the Bayeux Tapestry, for its
evidence is dead against him, and he cannot explain it away. His
first attempt was a brief allusion, accepting its authority without
question, but suggesting that it might represent that part of the line
where the barricade was absent.<a id="footnotetagbh31" name="footnotetagbh31"></a><a href="#footnotebh31"><sup>31</sup></a>
Of this suggestion I at once disposed
by showing that it is 'not only absolutely without foundation,
but is directly opposed to Mr Freeman's theory, and, indeed, to his
express statements'.<a id="footnotetagbh32" name="footnotetagbh32"></a><a href="#footnotebh32"><sup>32</sup></a>
Forced to drop this explanation, my opponent,
in his next article, fell back on the desperate device of repudiating the
authority of the Tapestry,<a id="footnotetagbh33" name="footnotetagbh33"></a><a href="#footnotebh33"><sup>33</sup></a>
'the most authentic record' of the
battle according to the late Professor, who was never weary of insisting
on its 'paramount importance'. On my showing, beyond the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>[pg 271]</span>
possibility of question, that this amounted to rejecting everything
that Mr Freeman had written on the subject,<a id="footnotetagbh34" name="footnotetagbh34"></a><a href="#footnotebh34"><sup>34</sup></a>
Mr Archer once more shifts his tactics, and now writes thus:</p>

<blockquote><p>
If any fact in Hastings is more certain than another, it is that at the
beginning of the battle the main body of the English was posted <em>on a hill</em>.
Now 'the priceless record'&mdash;the Bayeux Tapestry&mdash;represents them <em>on a
plain</em>. If the Tapestry could leave out this central feature&mdash;the hill of Senlac&mdash;from
its picture of the <em>opening</em> battle, still more easily could it leave out the
intricate barriers upon the hill.<a id="footnotetagbh35" name="footnotetagbh35"></a><a href="#footnotebh35"><sup>35</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>This <i>ad captandum</i> argument is disposed of as easily as the others.
The Tapestry does not concern itself with landscape, and shows us
neither a hill nor a plain. It could not, on a narrow strip, show us
'the hill of Senlac', but it could&mdash;and would&mdash;show us the alleged
palisade. For not only does it strive under every difficulty to represent
such objects as churches, castles and houses, but it faithfully
shows us the 'palisade'<a id="footnotetagbh36" name="footnotetagbh36"></a><a href="#footnotebh36"><sup>36</sup></a>
raised by William at Hastings itself. And if
it be urged that it could not depict men fighting behind such a
defence, let us turn to the scene at Dinan. If we compare it with the
opening scene of the great battle itself, we see precisely similar horsemen
advancing to the attack, similar infantry resisting that attack,
and similar spears flying between them. But at Dinan the defenders
have a palisade, and on the hill of battle they have not.<a id="footnotetagbh37" name="footnotetagbh37"></a><a href="#footnotebh37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>[pg 272]</span></p>

<p>But although the evidence of the Bayeux Tapestry, Mr Freeman's
own supreme authority, remains absolutely unshaken, it must not
be supposed that I rely on that evidence alone. I attach as much
importance as ever&mdash;and so will, I think, all prejudiced persons&mdash;to
the other portion of my argument, that if there had been a barricade
playing so important a part in the battle that Mr Freeman
found it needful to mention it at least a score of times, it is practically
inconceivable that all the authorities I enumerate should have
absolutely ignored its existence. Judging from Mr Freeman's
own experience, it would be simply impossible to describe the
battle without mentioning the 'palisade'.</p>

<p>It is very significant that when we turn to a real feature of the
English line, namely its close array, we find the above authorities as
unanimous in mentioning the fact as they are in ignoring that
'curious defence',<a id="footnotetagbh38" name="footnotetagbh38"></a><a href="#footnotebh38"><sup>38</sup></a>
those 'intricate barriers', as Mr Archer terms
them, 'upon the hill'.<a id="footnotetagbh39" name="footnotetagbh39"></a><a href="#footnotebh39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>

<p>The fight has raged so fiercely around this 'palisade' that I have
been obliged to discuss it at somewhat disproportionate length.
But to sum up, we have now seen, firstly, that the alleged palisade
was a new 'development', and needs, as such, special proof of its
existence; secondly, that of Mr Freeman's proofs, one at least must
admittedly be abandoned, while he himself has impugned the
other;<a id="footnotetagbh40" name="footnotetagbh40"></a><a href="#footnotebh40"><sup>40</sup></a>
thirdly, that the evidence, both positive and presumptive,
is altogether opposed to the existence of a palisade. In the narrative
of the battle we shall find Mr Freeman interpolating the alleged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>[pg 273]</span>
defence solely from his own imagination, such references proving, on
inquiry, to be imaginary and imaginary alone.<a id="footnotetagbh41" name="footnotetagbh41"></a><a href="#footnotebh41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>

<h4>THE SHIELD-WALL<a name="page273a" id="page273a"></a></h4>

<p>It is a pleasure to find myself here in complete agreement with Mr
Freeman. In his very latest study of the battle Mr Freeman wrote as
follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>
The English clave to the old Teutonic tactics. They fought on foot in the
close array of the shield-wall.<a id="footnotetagbh42" name="footnotetagbh42"></a><a href="#footnotebh42"><sup>42</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>[pg 274]</span></p>

<p>Mr Archer says they cannot have done so.<a id="footnotetagbh43" name="footnotetagbh43"></a><a href="#footnotebh43"><sup>43</sup></a>
There was also, according to Mr Freeman, a barricade, in front of&mdash;and distinct from&mdash;the
shield-wall, being a special development which, he tells us, 'the
foresight of Harold' had introduced on this occasion (pp. 444, 468).
The barricade is denied by me, the shield-wall by Mr Archer.
Whichever of us is right, Mr Freeman's accuracy is, in either case,
equally impugned.</p>

<p>It is essential to remember that Mr Freeman, throughout,
treated the palisade and the shield-wall as <em>separate and distinct</em>.
Thus he wrote so late as 1880:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Besides the palisade the front ranks made a kind of inner defence with
their shields, called the shield-wall. The Norman writers were specially
struck with the close array of the English.<a id="footnotetagbh44" name="footnotetagbh44"></a><a href="#footnotebh44"><sup>44</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>So in his great work we read of 'the shield-wall <i>and the</i> triple
palisade still unbroken' (iii. 467). Later still 'the shield-wall still
stood <em>behind the</em> palisade' (p. 487). Even when 'the English palisade
was gone <em>the English shield-wall</em> was still a formidable hindrance in
the way of the assailants (p. 491). The array of the shield-wall was
still kept, though now without the help of the barricades' (p. 491).
Here we have the very phrase of note NN, 'the array of the shield-wall',<a id="footnotetagbh45" name="footnotetagbh45"></a><a href="#footnotebh45"><sup>45</sup></a>
and it is shown beyond question that Mr Freeman's shield-wall,
whatever Mr Archer may pretend, was quite distinct from the
palisade, and was a shield-wall 'pure and simple'.</p>

<p>Let it also be clearly understood what Mr Freeman meant by that
'array of the shield-wall', of which the disputed passage in Wace was,
he held, a description. He shows us the whole English army 'ranged
so closely together in the thick array of the shield-wall, that while
they only kept their ground the success of an assailant was hopeless'.<a id="footnotetagbh46" name="footnotetagbh46"></a><a href="#footnotebh46"><sup>46</sup></a>
He describes them as, 'a strong line, or rather wedge, of
infantry, forming a wall with their shields',<a id="footnotetagbh47" name="footnotetagbh47"></a><a href="#footnotebh47"><sup>47</sup></a>
and he ascribes their
defeat to their 'breaking the line of the shield-wall'.<a id="footnotetagbh48" name="footnotetagbh48"></a><a href="#footnotebh48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>

<p>Of this shield-wall my opponent rashly wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>
The Reviewer's [<i>sic</i>] theory of an extended shield-wall vanishes like smoke.
If Wace is any authority ... the question is settled once and for all. There
was no extended shield-wall at Hastings.<a id="footnotetagbh49" name="footnotetagbh49"></a><a href="#footnotebh49"><sup>49</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course, 'the Reviewer's theory' here is no other than Mr Freeman's
own.</p>

<p>If, in spite of the above evidence, it should still be pretended by
anyone that the plain meaning of Mr Freeman's words is not their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>[pg 275]</span>
meaning, I will refer them not to my own interpretation, but to that
of Mr Freeman's friend and colleague, the Rev W. Hunt, who
wrote in the historian's lifetime, 'at his request' and by his 'invitation',
and whose proofs were revised by Mr Freeman himself.<a id="footnotetagbh50" name="footnotetagbh50"></a><a href="#footnotebh50"><sup>50</sup></a>
This is Mr Hunt's version:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Set in close array behind a palisade forming a kind of fortification, <em>shoulder
to shoulder and shield to shield</em>, the army of Harold presented a steady and immovable
front to the Norman attack ... Fatal was the national formation of
the English battle, when <em>men stood in the closest order, forming a wall with their
shields</em>. While no mode of array could be stronger so long as the line remained
unbroken it made it hard to form the line again.<a id="footnotetagbh51" name="footnotetagbh51"></a><a href="#footnotebh51"><sup>51</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>So, again, in his life of Harold:</p>

<blockquote><p>
All the heavy-armed force fought in close order, <em>shield touching shield</em>, so as
to present a complete wall to the enemy.<a id="footnotetagbh52" name="footnotetagbh52"></a><a href="#footnotebh52"><sup>52</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Here we have no tortuous imaginings, but, in plain and straightforward
words, 'what historians in general evidently mean' when
they speak of a 'shield-wall', what it meant to Mr Freeman, what it
means to Mr Hunt, and it is admitted, to myself.<a id="footnotetagbh53" name="footnotetagbh53"></a><a href="#footnotebh53"><sup>53</sup></a>
Such was the English shield-wall, according to Mr Freeman, at 'Senlac'; it was
what Mr Archer definitely declares it cannot possibly have been.</p>

<p>Lastly, as to the ground on which Mr Archer pronounces impossible
a continuous shield-wall<a id="footnotetagbh54" name="footnotetagbh54"></a><a href="#footnotebh54"><sup>54</sup></a>
&mdash;namely, that the English could not have fought in such close order,<a id="footnotetagbh55" name="footnotetagbh55"></a><a href="#footnotebh55"><sup>55</sup></a>
and that the axe-men being 'shieldless ... could not have formed the shield-wall'; one need only
confront him with Mr Freeman's words.</p>

<p>I am compelled to repeat what I said in the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite>.</p>

<blockquote><p>
We almost hesitate to waste our own and our readers' time on a writer
who, professing to vindicate Mr Freeman's view as against us, devotes his
energies to proving that view to be utterly absurd.<a id="footnotetagbh59" name="footnotetagbh59"></a><a href="#footnotebh59"><sup>59</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Nor will Mr Archer derive comfort from 'our only English
"specialist" on mediaeval warfare';<a id="footnotetagbh60" name="footnotetagbh60"></a><a href="#footnotebh60"><sup>60</sup></a>
who holds, as I had pointed
out, that 'the English axemen' did fight 'arranged in a compact
mass'.<a id="footnotetagbh61" name="footnotetagbh61"></a><a href="#footnotebh61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>

<p>It is significant that the fact Mr Archer so confidently rejects is
precisely that on which I am at one with Mr Freeman, Mr Hunt,
and Mr Oman, and to which the original authorities bear witness
with peculiar unanimity. Thus William of Poitiers, an authority of
the first rank, describes the English as 'maxime conferti', speaks of
their 'nimia densitas', and proceeds to dwell on the terrible effect of
their weapon, the famous battle-axe. William of Malmesbury tells
us that the axemen 'impenetrabilem cuneum faciunt'. Even Mr
Archer's authority, Wace, writes of these warriors:</p>

<div class="poem width15">  <div class="stanza">
<p>A pie furent <i>serrement</i>.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Baudri describes the English as 'consertos',<a id="footnotetagbh62" name="footnotetagbh62"></a><a href="#footnotebh62"><sup>62</sup></a>
and the <i>Brevis Relatio</i> as
'spissum agmen'. Bishop Guy writes of the 'spissum nemus Angligenarum',
and styles them 'densissima turba'; Henry of Huntingdon,
we saw, tells us that they were arranged 'in una acie strictissime',
and were thus 'impenetrabiles Normannis'.</p>

<p>No feature of the great battle is more absolutely beyond dispute.
It was the denseness of the English ranks that most vividly struck
their foes. 'Shield to shield, and shoulder to shoulder', as &AElig;thelred
describes them at the Battle of the Standard, they wedged themselves
together so tightly that the wounded could not move, nor
even the corpses drop. And so they stood together, the living and the
dead.<a id="footnotetagbh63" name="footnotetagbh63"></a><a href="#footnotebh63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>

<p>And we must remember that this mass of men was 'ranged so
closely together in the thick array <i>of the shield-wall</i>, that while they
only kept their ground the success of an assailant was hopeless'.<a id="footnotetagbh64" name="footnotetagbh64"></a><a href="#footnotebh64"><sup>64</sup></a>
The Conqueror saw, Mr Freeman reminds us, 'that his only chance
was to tempt the English to break their shield-wall'.<a id="footnotetagbh65" name="footnotetagbh65"></a><a href="#footnotebh65"><sup>65</sup></a>
I need not insist on the point further: I need not even have said so much, but that
some of those who read these pages may not have realized the true
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>[pg 277]</span>
character of Mr Archer's phantasies. The 'scutorum testudo',
as William of Malmesbury describes the famous shield-wall,<a id="footnotetagbh66" name="footnotetagbh66"></a><a href="#footnotebh66"><sup>66</sup></a>
is depicted, with his usual painstaking care, by the designer of the
Bayeux Tapestry. We read of the 'testudo' at Ashdown fight, even in
the days of Alfred;<a id="footnotetagbh67" name="footnotetagbh67"></a><a href="#footnotebh67"><sup>67</sup></a>
it was, again, with the shield-wall that 'glorious
&AElig;thelstan' won the day on the hard-fought field of Brunanburh
(937);<a id="footnotetagbh68" name="footnotetagbh68"></a><a href="#footnotebh68"><sup>68</sup></a>
we hear of it at Maldon (991), where Brihtnoth, we read,
'bade his men work the war-hedge',&mdash;'that is, had made his men
form the shield-wall, a sort of fortress made by holding their shields
close together'.<a id="footnotetagbh69" name="footnotetagbh69"></a><a href="#footnotebh69"><sup>69</sup></a>
And we do, in Mr Freeman's words, meet with it
'down to the end', when the war-hedge of Maldon was wrought
anew, by Harold, on the hill of battle, and stood once more as if a
fortress&mdash;'quasi castellum'.</p>

<h4>THE DISPOSITION OF THE ENGLISH<a name="page277a" id="page277a"></a></h4>

<p>To render clear the problem involved, I must first sketch as briefly
as possible the nature of the ground the English held. The hill of
battle is so fully described in Mr Freeman's narrative that I here
need only explain that it was a long narrow spur of the downs,
running nearly east and west, of which the south front was defended
by the English and attacked by the Normans. The one and only
point that is certain is that 'on the very crown of the hill', the site of
the high altar in the future, was erected the standard of Harold.<a id="footnotetagbh70" name="footnotetagbh70"></a><a href="#footnotebh70"><sup>70</sup></a>
This, then, the centre of the hill, was the centre of the English host.
But the ground to which our attention is directed, as having 'really
played the most decisive part in the great event of the place', lay
to the west of this, 'where the slope is gentlest of all, where the access
to the natural citadel is least difficult'.<a id="footnotetagbh71" name="footnotetagbh71"></a><a href="#footnotebh71"><sup>71</sup></a>
Mr Freeman assumes that
this ground&mdash;the 'English right', as he terms it&mdash;where the 'ascent
is easiest in itself', was allotted to 'the least trustworthy portion of
the English army', to 'the sudden levies of the southern shires'.<a id="footnotetagbh72" name="footnotetagbh72"></a><a href="#footnotebh72"><sup>72</sup></a>
For this assumption, I hasten to add, there is no authority whatever.
He further assumes that the first English to leave their post, in pursuit
of the enemy, 'were, of course, some of the defenders of the
English right'.<a id="footnotetagbh73" name="footnotetagbh73"></a><a href="#footnotebh73"><sup>73</sup></a>
William, he holds, at the crisis of the battle, resolved
to draw them again from their post by a partial feigned retreat, that
'meanwhile another division might reach the summit through the gap
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>[pg 278]</span>
thus left open'. Accordingly, tempted by this stratagem, 'the
English on the right wing rushed down and pursued', and their
error proved 'fatal to England'.<a id="footnotetagbh74" name="footnotetagbh74"></a><a href="#footnotebh74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>

<blockquote><p>
The Duke's great object was now gained; the main end of Harold's skilful
tactics had been frustrated by the inconsiderate ardour of the least valuable
portion of his troops. Through the rash descent of the light-armed on the
right, the whole English army lost its vantage-ground. The pursuing English
had left the most easily accessible portion of the hill open to the approach of
the enemy.... The main body of the Normans made their way on to the hill,
no doubt by the gentle slope at the point west of the present buildings. The
great advantage of the ground was now lost; the Normans were at last on the
hill.<a id="footnotetagbh75" name="footnotetagbh75"></a><a href="#footnotebh75"><sup>75</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Such is Mr Freeman's explanation of how the battle was won,<a id="footnotetagbh76" name="footnotetagbh76"></a><a href="#footnotebh76"><sup>76</sup></a>
for in this episode he discovers the decisive turning-point of the day.<a id="footnotetagbh77" name="footnotetagbh77"></a><a href="#footnotebh77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>

<p>Now, let us consider what is involved in the theory here set forth.
'Harold's skilful tactics', we find, consisted in entrusting his weakest
point, the least defensible portion of his position, to 'the least trustworthy
portion of the English army'. The natural result of these
insane tactics was that his weak point was forced, and the English
right turned.<a id="footnotetagbh78" name="footnotetagbh78"></a><a href="#footnotebh78"><sup>78</sup></a>
And Mr Freeman, having made this clear, complains
of 'the criticisms of monks on the conduct of a consummate
general', and insists that 'nowhere is Harold's military greatness so
distinctly felt as when ... we tread the battlefield of his own choice'.
But there is worse to come. Such tactics as these would have been
mad enough, even if these raw peasants had stood behind a barricade;
but if, as I hold, that barricade is a purely imaginary creation,
we ask ourselves what would have happened to these unhappy
creatures, protected by no 'shield-wall', and armed with 'such rustic
weapons as forks and sharp stakes',<a id="footnotetagbh79" name="footnotetagbh79"></a><a href="#footnotebh79"><sup>79</sup></a>
when, first riddled by Norman
arrows and then attacked by Norman infantry, they were finally,
broken and defenceless, charged by heavy cavalry. The first onslaught
would have scattered them to the winds, and have won, in
so doing, the key of the English position.<a id="footnotetagbh80" name="footnotetagbh80"></a><a href="#footnotebh80"><sup>80</sup></a>
Remembering this, it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>[pg 279]</span>
strange to learn that 'the consummate generalship of Harold is
nowhere more conspicuously shown than in this memorable
campaign', and that his was 'that true skill of the leader of armies,
which would have placed both Harold and William high among the
captains of any age'. But if the generalship of Harold was shown by
entrusting to his worst troops his weakest and most important point,
while posting 'the flower of the English army' just where his ground
was strongest, what are we to say of 'the generalship of William, his
ready eye, his quick thought', if he failed to detect and avail himself
of this glaring blunder? For instead of concentrating his attack upon
Harold's weak point, he left it to be assailed, we learn, by 'what was
most likely the least esteemed' portion of his host,<a id="footnotetagbh81" name="footnotetagbh81"></a><a href="#footnotebh81"><sup>81</sup></a>
while he himself with his picked troops dashed himself against an impregnable
position like a mad bull against a wall. 'We read,' says Mr Freeman,
'with equal admiration of the consummate skill with which
Harold chose his position and his general scheme of action, and of
the wonderful readiness with which William formed and varied his
plans.' For myself, I should have thought that the tactics he describes&mdash;tactics
which stirred him to a burst of admiration for 'the two
greatest of living captains'&mdash;would have disgraced the most incompetent
commander that ever took the field.</p>

<p>But Harold, after all, was no fool. Are we then justified in accusing
him of this supreme folly? Mr Freeman held that 'the relative position
of the different divisions in the two armies seems beyond doubt'.
There is, however, as I said, absolutely no evidence for Mr Freeman's
assumption that the English right was entrusted to the raw
levies. Against it is the fact that in this quarter the first assault was
soonest repulsed: against it also is all analogy drawn from the study
of English tactics. Snorro's description of Stamfordbridge is evidence,
at least, that 'the fortress of shields' had a continuous line of bucklers
along its whole front: &AElig;thelred gives us the reason in his story of the
Battle of the Standard; namely, that it was the front line which had
to meet the shock ('periculosum dicebant si primo aggressu inermes
armatis occurrerent'). It was therefore an essential principle of
tactics 'quatinus armati armatos impeterent, milites congrederentur
militibus'.<a id="footnotetagbh82" name="footnotetagbh82"></a><a href="#footnotebh82"><sup>82</sup></a>
Therefore on Cowton Moor (1138), as (I hold) on the
hill of Battle (1066), we find the 'strenuissimi milites in prima fronte
locati'.<a id="footnotetagbh83" name="footnotetagbh83"></a><a href="#footnotebh83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>[pg 280]</span></p>

<p>The words 'and the lighter troops behind them', which originally
followed here, have been objected to by Miss Norgate, who had
originally made the same statement,<a id="footnotetagbh84" name="footnotetagbh84"></a><a href="#footnotebh84"><sup>84</sup></a>
but who now wishes to
withdraw it.<a id="footnotetagbh85" name="footnotetagbh85"></a><a href="#footnotebh85"><sup>85</sup></a>
Henry of Huntingdon, however&mdash;like &AElig;thelred, a
contemporary authority&mdash;agrees with him in describing the dismounted
knights, men with shields and <i>loric&aelig;</i> like the 'housecarls'
at Hastings, as forming an 'iron wall' along the English front.<a id="footnotetagbh86" name="footnotetagbh86"></a><a href="#footnotebh86"><sup>86</sup></a>
If then mailed warriors formed the front line, it is difficult to see
where the 'inermis plebs', as &AElig;thelred terms it, could be but 'behind
them'. The fact is that the Battle of the Standard, for which we
have excellent authorities, is of no small value for the study of the
Battle of Hastings, as my opponents seem to be uncomfortably
aware. 'The tactics,' Mr Freeman admits, 'were English.' We find
there again the same dense array,<a id="footnotetagbh87" name="footnotetagbh87"></a><a href="#footnotebh87"><sup>87</sup></a>
the same tactics for defence,
though now rendered less passive by the development of the bowman.<a id="footnotetagbh88" name="footnotetagbh88"></a><a href="#footnotebh88"><sup>88</sup></a>
There can, I think, be little question, if we combine the
several accounts, that the Standard, with the older chiefs around it,
formed the kernel of the host;<a id="footnotetagbh89" name="footnotetagbh89"></a><a href="#footnotebh89"><sup>89</sup></a>
that the rude levies of the shire were
massed round about them;<a id="footnotetagbh90" name="footnotetagbh90"></a><a href="#footnotebh90"><sup>90</sup></a>
and that the outer rim was formed by
the mailed knights, with the archers crouching for shelter behind
their 'iron wall'.</p>

<p>Harking back to Sherstone fight (1016), we encounter precisely
the same formation. 'The King,' Mr Freeman writes, 'placed his
best troops in front, and the inferior part of his army in the rear.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>[pg 281]</span>
And he added, 'we must remember these tactics when we come to the
great fight of Senlac'.<a id="footnotetagbh91" name="footnotetagbh91"></a><a href="#footnotebh91"><sup>91</sup></a>
This was, unhappily, just what he failed to
do. 'William of Poitiers,' he strangely complained, 'has his head full
of Agamemnon and of Xerxes, but this obvious analogy does not
seem to have occurred to him.' Have we also the reason why our
author himself overlooked these obvious analogies in the fact that to
illustrate the Battle of Hastings he quotes some five and twenty
times from the Odyssey and the Iliad, from Herodotus and Xenophon,
from &AElig;schylus, Plutarch, and Dio Cassius; from Livy,
Tacitus, Ammianus, and even &AElig;lius Spartianus? In his later edition,
however, he inserted in a footnote the words: 'On placing the
inferior troops in the rear, see the tactics of Eadmund at Sherstone.'<a id="footnotetagbh92" name="footnotetagbh92"></a><a href="#footnotebh92"><sup>92</sup></a>
'In the <em>rear</em>?' Yes, but that is precisely my contention. The assumption
that I am assailing is that they formed the <em>wings</em>.</p>

<p>But we are not even here at the end of Mr Freeman's confusion.
He had meanwhile, in another work, published about the same time
as the first edition of his third volume, written thus:</p>

<blockquote><p>
As far as I can see, King Harold put these bad troops <em>in the back</em> ... But
his picked men he put <em>in front</em>, where the best troops of the enemy were
likely to come.<a id="footnotetagbh93" name="footnotetagbh93"></a><a href="#footnotebh93"><sup>93</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>This is exactly my own view; it is that 'essential principle of tactics'
on which I have insisted throughout, and on which Miss Norgate has
rashly endeavoured to pour contempt.<a id="footnotetagbh94" name="footnotetagbh94"></a><a href="#footnotebh94"><sup>94</sup></a>
Mr Freeman, moreover,
further on, wrote of his 'light armed' as 'the troops <em>in the rear</em>',<a id="footnotetagbh95" name="footnotetagbh95"></a><a href="#footnotebh95"><sup>95</sup></a>
which is again my contention. What seems to have happened is
that he got into his head (I can imagine how) that the 'light-armed'
formed the wings, and arranged the battle on that assumption.
Then remembering, when it was too late, that, according to his
own precedent, they ought to have been in the rear, he hesitated to
introduce a change which would affect his whole theory of the battle,
and compel him to approach it <i>de novo</i>.<a id="footnotetagbh96" name="footnotetagbh96"></a><a href="#footnotebh96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>

<p>But indeed, even apart from this, it seems doubtful, examining
Mr Freeman's narrative, whether he had formed a clear conception
of how the English troops were arranged, and whether, if so, he
kept it in view, consistently, throughout. If we honestly seek to learn
what his conception was, a careful comparison of pp. 472, 473, 475,
490, and 505, with the ground-plan, will show that the whole right
wing was composed of 'light-armed troops, who broke their line to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>[pg 282]</span>
pursue'. And this view seems to be accepted and defended by Miss
Norgate, who, writing as his champion, declares that to her the
conclusion embodied in his ground-plan 'seems irresistible'.<a id="footnotetagbh97" name="footnotetagbh97"></a><a href="#footnotebh97"><sup>97</sup></a>
On the other hand, pp. 471, 480, 487, and 732 most undoubtedly
convey the impression that, as I have maintained, the heavy-armed
English were extended along the whole front,<a id="footnotetagbh98" name="footnotetagbh98"></a><a href="#footnotebh98"><sup>98</sup></a>
and that their defeat, in Mr Freeman's words (p. 732), was 'owing to their breaking
the line of the shield-wall'. I suspect that he was led thus to contradict
himself by the obvious concentration of his interest on 'the great
personal struggle which was going on beneath the standard' (p.
487). Here, as is often the case throughout his work, Mr Freeman's
treatment of his subject was essentially dramatic. To bring his
heroes into high relief, he thrust into the background the rest of his
scene as of comparatively small account. In this spirit, for instance,
he wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>
A new act in the awful drama of that day had now begun. The Duke himself,
at the head of his own Normans, again pressed towards the standard....
A few moments more and the mighty rivals might have met face to face,
and the war-club of the Bastard might have clashed against the lifted axe of
the Emperor of Britain (p. 483).
</p></blockquote>

<p>Homer, doubtless, would have made them meet; but a great
dramatic opportunity was lost: the 'mighty rivals' seem never to
have got within striking distance. Meanwhile, however, the warring
hosts are left quite in the background; their fate is that of a stage
crowd engaged in a stage battle. I do not mean, of course, that Mr
Freeman ignores them, but that he was so engrossed in the personal
exploits of his heroes as to be impatient of that careful study which
the battle as a whole required, and comparatively careless of consistency
in his allusions to the English array.</p>

<p>The charge, in short, that I have brought throughout against the
disposition of the English in Mr Freeman's narrative is that his
view, 'with all that it involves, was based on no authority, was
merely the offspring of his own imagination, and was directly at
variance with the only precedent that he vouched for the purpose'.<a id="footnotetagbh99" name="footnotetagbh99"></a><a href="#footnotebh99"><sup>99</sup></a>
There is absolutely not a scrap of evidence that&mdash;as shown on the
'accurate' ground-plan&mdash;the English army was drawn up in three
divisions, the 'housecarls' forming the centre, and the 'light-armed'
the two wings. We do not even know that it formed an almost straight
line.<a id="footnotetagbh100" name="footnotetagbh100"></a><a href="#footnotebh100"><sup>100</sup></a>
The whole arrangement is sheer guesswork, and analogy,
here our only guide, is wholly against it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>[pg 283]</span></p>

<p>I cannot insist too strongly on the charge I have here made. It is
no 'matter of secondary importance';<a id="footnotetagbh101" name="footnotetagbh101"></a><a href="#footnotebh101"><sup>101</sup></a>
nor is it the case that my
argument as to the 'palisade' is, as Mr Archer pretended, 'the only
definite and palpable charge' that I bring 'against Mr Freeman's
account of the great battle'.<a id="footnotetagbh102" name="footnotetagbh102"></a><a href="#footnotebh102"><sup>102</sup></a>
For, as I wrote from the very first,
'rejecting Mr Freeman's views on the groupings of the English host,
we reject with them <i>in toto</i> the story he has built upon
them'.<a id="footnotetagbh103" name="footnotetagbh103"></a><a href="#footnotebh103"><sup>103</sup></a></p>

<p>My own view is based upon the fact that, in the military tactics as
in the military architecture of the age, the defence trusted largely
to its power of passive resistance: this was the essential principle of
the ponderous Norman keep; and precisely as the walls of that keep
were formed of an ashlar face of masonry backed by masses of
rubble, so the fighting line of a force standing on the defensive was
composed of a compact facing of heavily-armed troops backed by a
rabble of half-armed peasants, or at best by what we may term the
light infantry of the day. When the foe was advancing to the
attack, these rear lines could discharge such weapons as they
possessed&mdash;darts, arrows, stones, etc.&mdash;from behind the shelter of
their comrades,<a id="footnotetagbh104" name="footnotetagbh104"></a><a href="#footnotebh104"><sup>104</sup></a>
while at the moment of actual shock they would
form a passive backing, which would save the front ranks from being
broken by the enemy's impact. As the great object of the attack
was to break through the line, a formation which virtually gave the
advantage now possessed by a solid over a hollow square would
naturally commend itself to the defence.</p>

<p>Now in these tactics we have the key to the true story of the battle.
But, first, we must dismiss from our minds Mr Freeman's fundamental
assumption, and understand that the English 'hoplites'
were not massed in the centre, but were extended along the whole
front, precisely as they were in battles fought both before and after.
The fighting face of Harold's host was composed of this heavy
soldiery, clad in helmets and mail. Arrayed in the closest order, they
presented to an advancing enemy the aspect of a living rampart
('quasi castellum').</p>

<p>How the Normans attacked that rampart it will now be my task
to show.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>[pg 284]</span></p>

<h4>THE NORMAN ADVANCE</h4>

<p>From Telham Hill Duke William scanned that living rampart,
and saw clearly that 'his only chance was to tempt the English to
break their shield-wall'.<a id="footnotetagbh105" name="footnotetagbh105"></a><a href="#footnotebh105"><sup>105</sup></a>
It is chiefly from Baudri's poem that we
learn how he set about it.<a id="footnotetagbh106" name="footnotetagbh106"></a><a href="#footnotebh106"><sup>106</sup></a></p>

<p>There is no question that the fight began with an advance of the
Norman infantry. William of Poitiers and Bishop Guy are in complete
accordance on the fact.<a id="footnotetagbh107" name="footnotetagbh107"></a><a href="#footnotebh107"><sup>107</sup></a>
But as my description of the infantry
has been challenged,<a id="footnotetagbh108" name="footnotetagbh108"></a><a href="#footnotebh108"><sup>108</sup></a>
I may show that it is quite beyond dispute.<a id="footnotetagbh109" name="footnotetagbh109"></a><a href="#footnotebh109"><sup>109</sup></a>
To my argument, as reprinted below, it has been objected that I fail
'to take account of the distinction between light-armed and heavy-armed
infantry'.<a id="footnotetagbh110" name="footnotetagbh110"></a><a href="#footnotebh110"><sup>110</sup></a>
It will be seen that my argument turns, not on
the armour, but on the <em>weapons</em> of the foot. I have challenged my
opponents to produce mention of any weapons but crossbows,<a id="footnotetagbh111" name="footnotetagbh111"></a><a href="#footnotebh111"><sup>111</sup></a>
or bows and arrows, and need scarcely say that they cannot.</p>

<p>Describing the 'armour and weapons of the Normans', Mr
Freeman, avowedly following the Tapestry, represented the
infantry as all archers,<a id="footnotetagbh112" name="footnotetagbh112"></a><a href="#footnotebh112"><sup>112</sup></a>
and divided them into two classes: (1)
those 'without defensive harness'; (2) those who 'wore the defences
common to the horse and foot of both armies ... the close-fitting
coat of mail ... and the conical helmet'.<a id="footnotetagbh113" name="footnotetagbh113"></a><a href="#footnotebh113"><sup>113</sup></a>
Now this division is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>[pg 285]</span>
exactly reproduced in the words of William of Poitiers, who divides
his 'pedites' into two classes, distinguished only by the fact that in
one were the 'firmiores et loricatos'. He does not say that the latter
were <em>not</em> archers, or crossbowmen, nor did Mr Freeman venture to
assign them any other weapons.<a id="footnotetagbh114" name="footnotetagbh114"></a><a href="#footnotebh114"><sup>114</sup></a>
Bishop Guy, moreover, distinctly
tells us that they were crossbowmen (<i>vide infra</i>). The advance,
therefore, in modern language, consisted of skirmishers, represented
by archers and perhaps some crossbowmen; supports, namely,
crossbowmen who, as a somewhat superior class, would mostly have
defensive armour; and, lastly, the cavalry as reserve.<a id="footnotetagbh115" name="footnotetagbh115"></a><a href="#footnotebh115"><sup>115</sup></a></p>

<p>Now what was the intention of this advance? Mr Freeman
assumed, without hesitation, that the foot 'were to strive to break
down the palisades ... and so to make ready the way for the charge
of the horse' (p. 467); that 'the infantry were, therefore, exposed to
the first and most terrible danger' (<cite>Ibid.</cite>); 'that the French infantry
had to toil up the hill, and to break down the palisade' (p. 477).<a id="footnotetagbh116" name="footnotetagbh116"></a><a href="#footnotebh116"><sup>116</sup></a>
But we find, on reference, that the above writers say nothing of any
such intention, and do not even mention the existence of a palisade.<a id="footnotetagbh117" name="footnotetagbh117"></a><a href="#footnotebh117"><sup>117</sup></a>
Moreover, the only weapons they speak of are crossbows and bows
and arrows, which are scarcely the tools for pioneers. But William
of Poitiers puts us on the track of a very different explanation:
'Pedites itaque Normanni propius accedentes <i>provocant</i> Anglos,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>[pg 286]</span>
missilibus in eos vulnera dirigunt atque necem'. Here Baudri
comes to our aid:</p>

<div class="poem width21">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Nam neque Normannus consertos audet adire</p>
<p class="i2">Nec valet a cuneo quemlibet excipere.</p>
<p>Arcubus utantur dux imperat atque balistis;</p>
<p class="i2">Nam prius has mortes Anglia tunc didicit.</p>
<p>Tunc didicere mori quam non novere sagitta</p>
<p class="i2">Creditur a c&aelig;lo mors super ingruere</p>
<p>Hos velut a longe comitatur militis agmen,</p>
<p class="i2">Palantes post se miles ut excipiat.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>The Normans dared not face the serried ranks of the English: the
maxim that cavalry should not charge unbroken infantry was
asserting itself already. But the only means of breaking those ranks,
of throwing the English into confusion, was to gall them by archers
and slingers till some of them should sally forth, when their assailants
would turn tail and leave them to be caught in the open and ridden
down. As Bishop Guy expresses it:</p>

<div class="poem width21">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Pr&aelig;misit pedites committere bella sagittis,</p>
<p class="i2">Et balistantes inserit in medio,</p>
<p>Quatinus infigant volitantia vultibus arma,</p>
<p class="i2">Vulneribusque datis ora retro faciant,</p>
<p>Ordine post pedites sperat stabilire Quirites</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>These tactics, says Baudri, were crowned with success; the maddened
English, as they dashed forth to strike their tormentors to the
ground, were cut off in every direction by the horsemen waiting
their chance:</p>

<div class="poem width21">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Tunc pr&aelig; tristitia gens effera pr&aelig;que pudore</p>
<p class="i2">Egreditur palans, insequiturque vagos.</p>
<p>Normanni simulantque fugam fugiuntque fugantes,</p>
<p class="i2">Intercepit eos undique pr&aelig;pes equus.</p>
<p>Ilico c&aelig;duntur; sic paulatim minuuntur,</p>
<p class="i2">Nec minuebatur callidus ordo ducis.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>This account is both intelligible and consistent, but differs wholly
from that of Mr Freeman. It had, however, been virtually anticipated
by Mr Oman, who in his <cite>Art of War in the Middle Ages</cite> (p.
25), points out, with much felicity, that</p>

<blockquote><p>
the archers, if unsupported by the knights, could easily have been driven
off the field by a general charge. United, however, by the skilful tactics of
William, the two divisions of the invading army won the day. The Saxon
mass was subjected to exactly the same trial which befell the British squares
in the battle of Waterloo: incessant charges by a gallant cavalry were
alternated with a destructive fire of missiles. Nothing can be more maddening
than such an ordeal to the infantry soldier, rooted to the spot by the necessities
of his formation.
</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>[pg 287]</span></p>

<p>Let us compare the two theories. Mr Freeman's, here again, is
not even consistent. He first tells us that for the knights to charge,
with 'the triple palisade still unbroken, would have been sheer
madness'; in fact it was 'altogether useless' for them to advance until
the infantry had broken down the palisade.<a id="footnotetagbh118" name="footnotetagbh118"></a><a href="#footnotebh118"><sup>118</sup></a>
But this the infantry
failed to do,<a id="footnotetagbh119" name="footnotetagbh119"></a><a href="#footnotebh119"><sup>119</sup></a>
whereupon&mdash;the cavalry charged 'the impenetrable
fortress of timber' (p. 479)! One is surely reminded of the
immortal Don, when 'a todo el galope de Rocinante', he charged
the windmill.</p>

<p>My own theory involves no such inconsistencies. I hold&mdash;not as a
conjecture based on a hypothetical palisade, but on the excellent
authority of Baudri and William of Poitiers, that the infantry were
used for the definite purpose of galling the English by their missiles,
and so enticing them to leave their ranks and become a prey to the
horse. As soon as their line had thus been broken, the cavalry were
to charge.</p>

<p>Up to this point, the English army, as a whole, had kept its
formation; but now the strain on its patience had become too great
to be borne. Breaking its ranks, with one accord, the whole host
rushed upon its foes, and drove them before it in confusion right up
to the Duke's post:</p>

<div class="poem width21">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Tandem jactura gens irritata frequenti,</p>
<p class="i2">Ordinibus spretis irruit unanimis.</p>
<p>Tunc quoque plus solito fugientum terga cecidit,</p>
<p class="i2">Et miles vultum fugit ad usque ducis.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>This explains what had always been to me a difficulty, namely, the
panic-stricken flight of the Normans at this stage of the battle. That
they should have 'lost heart' (p. 480) at the firmness of the English is
natural enough; but that they should have 'turned and fled' (<cite>Ibid.</cite>)
from a force which did not pursue them seemed improbable. The
difficulty is solved by Baudri's mention of the wild onslaught
by the English. Moreover, Bishop Guy's description of the rout
of the assailants&mdash;which Mr Freeman assigned to this stage of the
battle&mdash;agrees well with that of Baudri:</p>

<div class="poem width21">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Anglorum populus, numero superante, repellit</p>
<p class="i2">Hostes inque retro compulit ora dari;</p>
<p>Et fuga ficta prius fit tunc virtute coacta;</p>
<p class="i2">Normanni fugiunt, dorsa tegunt clipei.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Again, Baudri's poem suggests a novel view by its definite statement
that the Normans in their flight reached the Duke's post. Mr
Freeman imagined that the Duke himself had been fighting in the
front line (pp. 479, 480), but a careful comparison of his two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>[pg 288]</span>
authorities, William of Poitiers and Bishop Guy (p. 482), will show
that, on the contrary, they support Baudri's statement. Each speaks
of the Duke as 'meeting' (<i>occurrens</i>&mdash;<i>occurrit</i>) the fugitives, a difficulty
which Mr Freeman evaded by writing that 'he met <em>or pursued</em> the
fugitives'.</p>

<p>From this flight the Normans were rallied by the desperate
efforts of the Duke himself, who, as is usual at such moments, was
believed to have fallen. I deem this episode a fixed point, and it
conveniently divides the battle. All our four leading authorities&mdash;the
Tapestry, William of Poitiers, Bishop Guy, and Baudri&mdash;are
here in complete agreement. William describes the Duke as 'nudato
insuper capite'; Guy tells us that 'iratus galea nudat et ipse caput';
Baudri writes 'subito galeam submovet a capite'; in the Tapestry,
'William (writes Dr Bruce), when he wishes to show himself in order
to contradict the rumour that he has been killed, is obliged to lift
his helmet almost off his head' (p. 98). It is singular that so striking
and well-established an episode is wholly ignored by Wace.</p>

<h4>THE FOSSE DISASTER<a name="page288a" id="page288a"></a></h4>

<p>The serious character of the assailants' flight is duly recognized by
Mr Freeman.<a id="footnotetagbh120" name="footnotetagbh120"></a><a href="#footnotebh120"><sup>120</sup></a>
We could have no more eloquent witness to the fact
than the admission even by William of Poitiers that the Duke's
Normans themselves gave way, or the description of them by
Bishop Guy as 'gens sua victa'. The only point in question here is
whether what I call 'the fosse disaster' was an incident of this headlong
flight or happened at a later stage of the battle. Mr Freeman,
discussing 'the order of events',<a id="footnotetagbh121" name="footnotetagbh121"></a><a href="#footnotebh121"><sup>121</sup></a>
faced the difficulty frankly, observing
that Guy had placed the feigned flight before what I have
termed above the dividing incident of the day, and that this view
'may be thought to be confirmed by the Tapestry', etc., etc. We
have here perhaps the most difficult problem raised in the course of
the battle, and one which it would be easier and safer to pass over in
silence. As to Guy, I suggest, as a possible solution&mdash;it does not
profess to be more&mdash;that what he was describing was not the great
feigned flight but the lesser man&oelig;uvres of the same character described
by Baudri above. He may, of course, have transferred to these
the importance of the later episode. On the real flight, at least, he is
sound. Of the Tapestry I would speak with more confidence. 'In the
nature of things,' Mr Freeman wrote, 'exact chronological order is
not its strongest point' (p. 768). But in this case there was nothing to
make it depart from that order, no reason why it should not place
the incident of 'the fosse disaster' after the central incident of the day,
instead of before, if that were its right position. Moreover, it is here,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>[pg 289]</span>
we find, in the closest agreement with Wace; and though I claim, as
did Mr Freeman, the right of rejecting his testimony when wholly
unsupported (as still more, when opposed to probability), yet such
marked agreement as this is not to be lightly cast aside.</p>

<p>In any case, nothing can be more unfortunate than Mr Freeman's
treatment of what he describes as the 'great slaughter of the
French in the western ravine' (p. 489). This is a scene invented by
Mr Freeman alone, and illustrates the peculiar use he made, at
times, of his authorities. There is no question that the Norman
knights suffered, in the course of the day, at least one such disaster
as the nobles of France at Courtrai (1302) or her cuirassiers at
Waterloo. But five authorities, so far as one can see, place the
incident in the thick of the battle, while three others assign it to the
pursuit of the defeated English. It is not strange, therefore, that some
writers should have held that there was but one such incident:
Mr Freeman, however, holds that there were two; and I expressly
disclaim questioning his view, the matter being one of opinion.
Assuming then, as he does, that the episode occurred in the course
of the battle, I turn to the spirited version of Wace, as Mr Archer
defies me to 'impeach Wace's authority' (p. 346). The 'old Norman
poet' is here very precise. He first tells us (ll. 7869-70, 8103-6) that
the English had made a 'fosse', which the Normans had passed unnoticed
in their advance.<a id="footnotetagbh122" name="footnotetagbh122"></a><a href="#footnotebh122"><sup>122</sup></a>
These passages Mr Freeman accepts
without question (p. 476). But then Wace proceeds to state (ll.
8107-20) that the Normans, driven back, as we have seen, by the
English, tumbled, men and horses, into this treacherous 'fosse' and
perished in great numbers. Now Wace, far from standing alone, is
here in curiously close agreement with the Tapestry of Bayeux.
Two successive scenes in that 'most authetic record' are styled 'Hic
ceciderunt simul Angli et Franci in pr&oelig;lio; hic Odo episcopus
baculum tenens confortat pueros.' Wace describes these scenes in
thirty-six lines (ll. 8103-38), devoting eighteen lines to the first and
the same number to the second. Actual comparison alone can show
how close the agreement is. Henry of Huntingdon, we may add,
independently confirms the statement that English as well as
French perished in the fatal fosse.<a id="footnotetagbh123" name="footnotetagbh123"></a><a href="#footnotebh123"><sup>123</sup></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>[pg 290]</span></p>

<p>Now all this is quite opposed to Mr Freeman's 'conception of the
battle'. He had, therefore, to adapt, with no gentle hands, his
authorities to his requirements. Cinderella's stepmother, when her
daughter's foot could not be got into the golden shoe, armed herself,
we read, with axe and scissors, and trimmed it to the requisite
shape. With no less decision the late Professor set about his own task.
Wace's evidence he simply suppressed; Henry of Huntingdon's he
ignored; but that of the Bayeux Tapestry could not be so easily
disposed of. I invite particular attention to his treatment of this, his
'highest authority'. Retaining in its natural place (pp. 481-2) the
second of the two scenes we have described, he threw forward the one
preceding it to a later stage of the battle (p. 490). Nor did his
vigorous adaptation stop even here. The scene thus wrenched from
its place depicts a single incident: mounted Normans are tumbling
headlong into a ditch at the foot of a mound, on which 'light-armed'
English stand assailing them with their weapons. The
fight is hand to hand; the bodies touch. And yet the Professor treats
this scene as a description of two quite separate events happening at
a distance from each other. These he terms (p. 489) the 'stand of the
English at the detached hill'; and the 'great slaughter of the French
in the western ravine'. But on referring to his own ground-plan, we
find that this 'ravine' and the 'detached hill' were a quarter of a
mile apart, with the slopes of the main hill between them.</p>

<p>My criticism here is twofold. In the first place, Mr Freeman
endeavoured to conceal the liberties he had taken with his leading
authority. No one would gather from his narrative of the battle
that any such violence had been used; nor would anyone who read
of the 'hill' episode that 'the scene is vividly shown in the Tapestry'
(p. 489), and, subsequently, of the 'ravine' disaster, that 'this
scene is most vividly shown in the Tapestry' (p. 490), imagine that
'the incidents of the ravine and the little hill' (p. 768) are in the
Tapestry one and the same. In the second place, the large part which
the writer's own imagination plays in his narrative of the fight is here
clearly seen. There is nothing, for instance, in any authority to
connect 'the western ravine' with 'the great slaughter of the French'.
It is placed by those who mention it in a 'fosse', 'fossatum', or 'fovea'.
'If Wace is any authority,' to quote Mr Archer's words, 'the question
is settled once and for all';<a id="footnotetagbh124" name="footnotetagbh124"></a><a href="#footnotebh124"><sup>124</sup></a>
the slaughter took place not in the
'ravine', but in a ditch which according to him, the English had
dug to the south of the hill, and which, according to Henry of
Huntingdon, they had cunningly concealed. Mr Freeman produces
no authority in support of his own fancy; his only argument is that
the slaughter</p>

<blockquote><p>
must have happened somewhere to the south or south-west of the hill. The
small ravine to the south-west seems exactly what is wanted (p. 771).
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>[pg 291]</span></p>

<p>The 'western ravine' however, does not fulfil these requirements
(see ground-plan, where it lies to the north-west of the hill); while
Wace's 'fosse', which&mdash;though here ignoring it&mdash;he had already
accepted, lay, as required, to the south of the hill. Wace mentions
another instance (ll. 1737-50) in which this stratagem was
adopted,<a id="footnotetagbh125" name="footnotetagbh125"></a><a href="#footnotebh125"><sup>125</sup></a>
but whether our ditch was dug, as he states, expressly or
not, the fact of its existence does not depend on his evidence alone.</p>

<p>To resume: accepting provisionally Mr Freeman's view (iii.
770) that there were two disasters to the horse, one 'happening
comparatively early in the battle', and the other 'which William of
Poitiers, Orderic and the Battle chronicler place at the very end of
the battle', as occurring in the pursuit of the defeated English, we
find that the former is mentioned by five writers. The Tapestry and
Wace agree absolutely in making it an episode of the real flight of
the Normans before the great rally; Henry of Huntingdon assigns
it to the great feigned flight, later in the battle; William of Malmesbury
seems to make it happen during the pursuit by the Normans
after their feigned flight; the anonymous writer quoted by Andresen
(ii. 713) from Le Prevost may be left out of the question. Yet, in
spite of all this contradiction, Mr Freeman assigns this striking
episode, not as a conjecture, but as historic fact, to the pursuit of the
English by the 'Bretons'<a id="footnotetagbh126" name="footnotetagbh126"></a><a href="#footnotebh126"><sup>126</sup></a>
after the feigned flight (p. 489). Let me
make my position clear. We expect an historian to weigh, as an
expert, the evidence before him: we look to him for guidance where
that evidence is conflicting. But we have a right to protest against the
statement, as historic fact, of hypotheses which cannot be established,
and which are quite possibly wrong. Where the evidence is flatly
contradictory, the fact that it is so should be made clear; conflicting
statements should not be evaded, nor evidence, such as that of the
Tapestry, appealed to, when it proves to be opposed to, not in favour
of, the writer's hypothesis. Dealing with the Conqueror's march on
London, after his great victory, Mr Parker has insisted with much
force, on the principle for which I am contending.</p>

<blockquote><p>
Though, by leaving out here and there the discrepancies, the residue may
be worked up into a consecutive and consistent series of events, such a process
amounts to making history, not writing it. Amidst a mass of contradictory
evidence, it is impossible to arrive at any sure conclusion.... It is,
however, comparatively easy to piece together such details as will fit of the
various stories, and still more easy to discover reasons for the results which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>[pg 292]</span>
such mosaic work produces ... [but] it cannot be reasonably regarded as
real history. The method by which the results are obtained bears too close
a resemblance to that by which ... some of the legends described in the
fifth chapter have come to be accepted as historical narratives.<a id="footnotetagbh127" name="footnotetagbh127"></a><a href="#footnotebh127"><sup>127</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>That is the danger. Such a narrative as that which Mr Freeman
has given us must 'come to be accepted as historical' if allowed to
pass current without a grave warning. It will doubtless be replied
that in his appendices, he frankly admits that 'it is often hard to
reconcile the various accounts'; but the question at issue is whether
one is justified when, as here, the various accounts are not only
'hard' but impossible to reconcile, in constructing a definite narrative
at all, instead of honestly admitting that the matter must be left in
doubt.</p>

<h4>THE GREAT FEIGNED FLIGHT<a name="page292a" id="page292a"></a></h4>

<p>There is no feature of the famous battle more familiar or more
certain than that of the feigned retreat. It is necessary here to grasp
Mr Freeman's view, because he discovers in this man&oelig;uvre and its
results the decisive turning point of the day.<a id="footnotetagbh128" name="footnotetagbh128"></a><a href="#footnotebh128"><sup>128</sup></a></p>

<p>That there was a great feigned flight, which induced a large portion
of the English to break their formation and pursue their foes, is beyond
question.<a id="footnotetagbh129" name="footnotetagbh129"></a><a href="#footnotebh129"><sup>129</sup></a>
But Mr Freeman, on this foundation, built up a
legend, for which, we shall find, there exists no evidence whatever.
He first assumed that it was 'most likely' the left wing of the assailants
which 'turned in seeming flight'<a id="footnotetagbh130" name="footnotetagbh130"></a><a href="#footnotebh130"><sup>130</sup></a>
(p. 488), and that it was, consequently,
'the English on the right wing' who 'rushed down and
pursued them'. Thus:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Through the rash descent of the light-armed on the right, the whole English
army lost its vantage ground. The pursuing English had left the most easily
accessible portion of the hill open to the approach of the enemy (p. 490).
</p></blockquote>

<p>The result, of course, was that 'the main body of the Normans
made their way on the hill, no doubt by the gentle slope' at this
point (<cite>Ibid.</cite>).</p>

<blockquote><p>
The great advantage of the ground was now lost; the Normans were at
last on the hill. Instead of having to cut their way up the slope, and through
the palisades, they could now charge to the east right against the defenders
of the standard (<cite>Ibid.</cite>).
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>[pg 293]</span></p>

<p>These words are most important. They set forth Mr Freeman's
theory that Harold now found the Normans charging down upon
his right flank instead of attacking him in front. It was in this
sense I wrote 'that his weak point was forced, and the English right
turned', as the natural result of the 'insane' tactics attributed to him
by his champion.<a id="footnotetagbh131" name="footnotetagbh131"></a><a href="#footnotebh131"><sup>131</sup></a>
The man&oelig;uvre assigned by Mr Freeman to
the Duke is, in fact, that by which Marlborough won the battle of
Ramillies, where he got on to the hill by dislodging the French right,
and then wheeled to his own right, outflanking the French centre.</p>

<p>When we turn from this elaborate theory to the authorities on
which it is supposed to be based, we find, with some astonishment,
that it is all sheer imagination. William of Poitiers, on whom the
writer seemed mainly to rely for the feigned flight, states that:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Normanni sociaque turba ... terga dederunt, fugam ex industri&acirc;
simulantes&mdash;
</p></blockquote>

<p>words which distinctly imply that this feigned flight was general.
Henry of Huntingdon merely writes: 'Docuit Dux Willelmus <i>genti su&aelig;</i>
fugam simulare.' No one, certainly, says or implies that it was restricted
to the left wing. As for the theory that 'the main body of the
Normans' were, by this man&oelig;uvre, enabled to seize the western
portion of the hill, and thus attack Harold on his flank, it is more
imaginary, if possible, still.</p>

<p>The fact is that, as I explained in my original article,<a id="footnotetagbh132" name="footnotetagbh132"></a><a href="#footnotebh132"><sup>132</sup></a>
Mr Freeman had wholly misconceived the nature of William's man&oelig;uvre.
The feigned flight was not a simple (as he supposed), but a
combined movement. The best account of that movement is found
in the Battle Chronicle:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Tandem strenuissimus Boloni&aelig; comes Eustachius clam, callida pr&aelig;meditata
arte&mdash;fugam cum exercitu duce simulante&mdash;super Anglos sparsim
agiliter insequentes cum manu valida a tergo irruit, <i>sicque et duce hostes
ferociter invadente ipsis interclusis utrinque</i> prosternuntur innumeri.
</p></blockquote>

<p>This precise statement, which Mr Freeman omits,<a id="footnotetagbh133" name="footnotetagbh133"></a><a href="#footnotebh133"><sup>133</sup></a>
affords the clue we seek, explaining the words of William of Poitiers, 'interceptos
et inclusos undique mactaverunt'. The retreat of the pursuing
English was cut off by the Count's squadrons, and, caught 'between
two fires', they were cut down and butchered. The supposition that,
while this was going on, the main body of the Normans was riding
on to the hill is baseless. The whole host, we have seen, were below,
surrounding the English who had left the hill. Had Mr Freeman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>[pg 294]</span>
kept in mind, as he had intended to do, the employment of this old
Norman device at the relief of Arques (1053), he would have seen
more clearly what really happened. But this, precisely as with his
Sherstone precedent, he failed to do.</p>

<h4>THE RELIEF OF ARQUES<a name="page294a" id="page294a"></a></h4>

<p>To illustrate the feigned flight by analogy, I append this passage
relating to the stratagem at Arques.</p>

<blockquote><p>
A plan was speedily devised; an ambush was laid; a smaller party was
sent forth to practise that stratagem of pretended flight which Norman craft
was to display thirteen years later [1066] on a greater scale. The Normans
turned; the French pursued; presently the liers-in-wait were upon them,
and the noblest and bravest of the invading host were slaughtered or taken
prisoners before the eyes of their king (iii. 133).
</p></blockquote>

<p>The man&oelig;uvre is elaborately described by Wace (ll. 3491-514)
in a passage which ought to be compared, in places, with that on
the great 'feinte fuie' itself (ll. 8203-70).</p>

<p>He carefully distinguishes the two parties essential to the stratagem:<a id="footnotetagbh134" name="footnotetagbh134"></a><a href="#footnotebh134"><sup>134</sup></a></p>

<div class="poem width18">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Partie pristrent des Normanz,</p>
<p>Des forz e des mielz cumbatanz,</p>
<p class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Puis pristrent une autre partie, etc., etc.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>The latter detachment turned in flight and decoyed some of the
leading Frenchmen past the spot where the ambush was laid. Then,
facing round, they caught their rash pursuers 'between two fires'.
I have shown above, from the 'precise statement' which is found in
the 'Battle Chronicle', that the great man&oelig;uvre which deceived the
English was a similarly combined one. Mr Freeman, completely
missing this point, makes the Norman 'division', which did not
take part in the flight 'ride up the hill' (p. 490), where its slopes
were deserted, whereas, on the contrary, they thrust themselves
between the pursuers and the hill, and then charged on their rear,
riding, of course, not on to, but away from the hill.</p>

<p>So close is the Arques parallel that in Wace we find the same words
occurring in both cases:</p>

while William of Malmesbury describes the French king as thus
'astutia insidiis exceptus', just as he describes Harold, in turn as
thus 'astuti&acirc; Willelmi circumventus'. Mr Freeman quoted both
passages, yet failed to note the parallel.</p>

<p>I speak, it will be seen, of 'the relief of Arques'. As my critic so
rashly assumed that in my original article I exhausted Mr Freeman's
errors,<a id="footnotetagbh135" name="footnotetagbh135"></a><a href="#footnotebh135"><sup>135</sup></a>
I may point out that this subject introduces us, at once, to
fresh ones. Our author, for instance, held that Arques was not
relieved. Let us see. We are first rightly told, on the authority of
William of Poitiers, that the Duke blockaded the stronghold
(<i>munitio</i>) by erecting a <i>castellum</i> at its foot (p. 128). On the next
page we are told that the latter was 'a wooden tower'&mdash;which is
precisely what it was not&mdash;and that it 'is described as a <i>munitio</i>' by
William of Poitiers, whereas that term, as we have just seen, denoted,
on the contrary, the rebel stronghold itself. Then we are told that the
French king marched to the relief of the rebels, bringing with him
'a good stock of provisions, of corn, and of wine' for the purpose, but
'was far from being successful in his enterprise' (p. 131). In fact, he
'went home, having done nothing towards the immediate object of
his journey&mdash;the relief of the besieged' (p. 137). Mr Freeman
added in a note: 'So I understand the not very clear statement of
William of Poitiers that the King went away.' Now, William's
statement (which is quoted by him) is absolutely clear:</p>

<blockquote><p>
<i>Perveniens tamen quo ire intenderat</i>, Rex exacerbatissimis animis summ&acirc; vi
pr&aelig;sidium attentavit: Willelmum ab &aelig;rumnis uti eriperet, pariter decrementum
sui, stragem suorum vindicaret.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The King, that is, in spite of the ambush, reached his destination
(the blockaded stronghold) and then furiously attacked the <i>castellum</i>
below, with the double object of raising the blockade and of avenging
the death of his followers. Wace is, if possible, even more explicit.
After describing the affair of the ambush, he proceeds thus:</p>

<div class="poem width18">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Les somiers fist apareilier,</p>
<p>La garisun prendre e chargier,</p>
<p><i>&Agrave; la tur d'Arches fist porter</i>,</p>
<p>Il meisme fu al mener (II. ll. 3519-22).</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Arques, therefore, was duly relieved; the blockading party being
only strong enough to defend, when attacked, its own <i>castellum</i>.</p>

<p>We will certainly not say of Mr Freeman that he had not read his
Wace 'with common care'&mdash;to quote from his criticism on Professor
Pearson&mdash;but really, when <i>more suo</i> he corrected <i>ex cathedr&acirc;</i> the faults
of others, he might at least have made sure of his facts. We will take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>[pg 296]</span>

of Harold on the eve of the Breton war:</p>

<p>But it is only the feigned flight that connects the Battle of Hastings
with Arques and its blockade. We read, as the battle is about to
begin, of 'the aged Walter Giffard, the lord of Longueville, the
hero of Arques and Mortemer' (p. 457). As our author breaks the
thread of his narrative (pp. 128-37) to tell us in detail about those
whose names occur in it, we need not scruple in this instance to do
the same. Turning back, therefore, we read:</p>

<blockquote><p>
The chief who now commanded below the steep of Arques lived to refuse
to bear the banner of Normandy below the steep of Senlac ... and to found,
like so many others among the baronage of Normandy, a short-lived earldom
in the land which he helped to conquer (p. 123).
</p></blockquote>

<p>In the act of that refusal he is thus described:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Even in the days of Arques [1053] and Mortimer [1054] he was an aged
man, and now [1066] he was old indeed; his hair was white, his arm was
failing (p. 465).
</p></blockquote>

<p>Yet we meet the veteran again, a generation later, as 'old Walter
Giffard, now [1090] Earl of Buckingham, in England ... the
aged warrior of Arques and Senlac' (<cite>W.R.</cite>, i. 231). 'Nor do we
wonder,' we read, 'to find,' among the supporters of William
Rufus in 1095, 'the name of Walter Giffard, him [<i>sic</i>] who appeared
as an aged man forty years before' (<cite>W.R.</cite>, i. 472). But even Mr
Freeman admits that 'we are somewhat surprised to find', among the
opponents of Henry I in 1101, 'now at the very end of his long life,
the aged Walter Giffard, lord of Longueville, and Earl of Buckingham'
(<cite>W.R.</cite>, ii. 395). Surprised? We are indeed; for, if he was 'an
aged man' half a century before, what must he have been when he
joined the rebels in 1101? It reminds one of a delightful passage in
the quaint 'Memorie of the Somervells', where the artless author,
speaking of the action, in 1213, of his ancestor 'being then near the
nyntieth and fourth year of his age', observes:</p>

<blockquote><p>
What could have induced him ... to join himself with the rebellious
barrons at such an age, when he could not act any in all human probabilitie,
and was as unfit for counsel, is a thing to be admired, but not understood or
knowne.
</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>[pg 297]</span></p>

<p>One need scarcely point out that Mr Freeman has confused two
successive bearers of the name. The confusion is avoided by the
Duchess of Cleveland in her work on 'The Battle Abbey Roll', as
it had been by Planch&eacute; and previous writers.</p>

<p>I here notice it chiefly as illustrating Mr Freeman's ready acceptance
of even glaring improbabilities.</p>

<p>But one of the most singular flaws in the late Professor's work was
his evident tendency to confuse two or more persons bearing the
same name. Three or four Leofstans of London were rolled by him
into one; Henry of Essex was identified with a Henry who had a
different father and who lived in Cumberland; while a whole string
of erroneous conclusions followed, we saw, from identifying Osbern
'filius Ricardi' with Osbern 'cognomine Pentecost'.<a id="footnotetagbh136" name="footnotetagbh136"></a><a href="#footnotebh136"><sup>136</sup></a>
It is strange that one who was so severe on confusion of identity where places
were concerned<a id="footnotetagbh137" name="footnotetagbh137"></a><a href="#footnotebh137"><sup>137</sup></a>
should have been, in the case of persons, guilty
of that confusion.</p>

<h4>SUMMARY<a name="page297a" id="page297a"></a></h4>

<p>I would now briefly recapitulate the points I claim to have
established. We have seen, in the first place, that Mr Freeman's
disposition of the English forces is, with all that it involves, nothing
but a sheer guess&mdash;a guess to which he did not consistently adhere,
and to which his own precedent, moreover, is directly opposed.
Secondly, as to the 'palisade' which formed, according to him, so
prominent a feature of the battle, we have found that of the passages
he vouched for its existence only one need even be considered; and
that one, according to himself, where he last quotes and deals with it,
describes, not a palisade but the time-honoured 'array of the shield-wall'.<a id="footnotetagbh138" name="footnotetagbh138"></a><a href="#footnotebh138"><sup>138</sup></a>
Then, passing to the battle and taking it stage by stage, I
have shown that on its opening phase he went utterly astray in
search of an imaginary assault on a phantom palisade; we have seen
how another such guess transported to 'the western ravine' a
catastrophe which, even on his own showing, must have happened
somewhere else, and assigned it to a stage of the battle which is
quite possibly the wrong one. We have watched him missing the
point of the great feigned flight and failing to see how Norman
craft caught the English in a trap. And lastly, the critical man&oelig;uvre
of the day, by which the Duke's great object was gained, and 'the
great advantage of the ground lost' to the English, proves on inquiry&mdash;although
introduced, like other assertions, as a historic fact&mdash;to
be yet another unsupported guess: for the statement that by this
man&oelig;uvre 'the Normans were at last on the hill' and could thus
'charge to the east right against the defenders of the Standard' there
is absolutely no foundation.</p>

<p>We have now&mdash;confining ourselves to points as to which there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>[pg 298]</span>
can be no question&mdash;examined Mr Freeman's account of the
Battle of Hastings. It is, as I showed at the outset, the very crown and
flower of his work, and it is, I venture to assert, mistaken in its
essential points. Must it, then, be cast aside as simply erroneous and
misleading? Hardly. In the words of his own criticism on Mr Coote's
<cite>Romans in Britain</cite>: 'It ought to be read, if only as a curious study, to
show how utterly astray an ingenious and thoroughly well-informed
man can go.' For there is the true conclusion. The possession of
exhaustive knowledge, the devotion of unsparing pains&mdash;neither
of these were wanting. Then 'wanting is&mdash;what?' Men have differed
and will always differ, as to how history should be written; but on
one point we are all agreed. The true historian is he, and he only,
who, from the evidence before him, can divine the facts. Other
qualities are welcome, but this is the essential gift. And it was
because, here at least, he lacked in that, in spite of all his advantages,
in spite of his genius and his zeal, our author, in his story of this
battle, failed as we have seen.</p>

<p>Mr Freeman held that his predecessors, Thierry and Sir Francis
Palgrave, 'singularly resemble each other in a certain lack of critical
power'. His own lack, as I conceive it, was of a somewhat different
kind. For if he studied the text and weighed the value of his authorities,
yet he was often liable to danger from his tendency to a <i>parti
pris</i>. Setting out with his own impression, he read his texts in the
light of that impression rather than with an open mind. Thus we
might say of his 'very lucid and original account' of the great battle,
as he said of Mr Coote's work: 'The truth of the whole matter is
that all this very ingenious but baseless fabric has been built upon
the foundation of a single error.' Had he not stumbled at the outset
over that 'quasi castellum', he might never have erected that
'ingenious but baseless fabric'. As it is, while the battle should be
largely rewritten, preserving only such incidents as are taken straight
from the authorities, the accompanying plan must be wholly
destroyed. Till then, as Dr Stubbs has said of the discovery that
'Ingulf' was a forgery, 'it remains a warning light, a wandering
marshfire, to caution the reader not to accept too abjectly the conclusions
of his authority'.</p>

<p>What then remains, it may be asked, of Mr Freeman's narrative?
When one remembers its superb vividness, carrying us away in
spite of ourselves, one is tempted to reply, in his own words on the
saga of Stamfordbridge:</p>

<blockquote><p>
We have, indeed, a glorious description which, when critically examined,
proves to be hardly more worthy of belief than a battlepiece in the Iliad....
Such is the magnificent legend which has been commonly accepted as
the history of this famous battle.... And it is disappointing that, for so
detailed and glowing a tale, we have so little of authentic history to substitute
(pp. 365-8).
</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>[pg 299]</span></p>

<p>For, as he has so justly observed, when dismissing as 'mythical' this
'famous and magnificent saga' (pp. 328-9), 'a void is left which
history cannot fill, and which it is forbidden to the historian to fill
up from the resources of his own imagination'.</p>

<p>Accepting the principle here enunciated by Mr Freeman himself,
I do not merely reject demonstrably erroneous statements. I
protest against his giving us a narrative drawn 'from the resources
of his own imagination'. It is no answer to say that his guesses
cannot be actually proved to be wrong; the historian cannot distinguish
too sharply between statements drawn from his authorities and
guesses, however ingenious, representing imagination alone. No one
I am sure, reading Mr Freeman's brilliant narrative, could imagine
how largely his story of the battle is based on mere conjecture.</p>

<p>What the battle really was may be thus tersely expressed&mdash;it was
Waterloo without the Prussians. The Normans could avail nothing
against that serried mass.</p>

<div class="poem width21">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Dash'd on every rocky square,</p>
<p>Their surging charges foam'd themselves away.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>As Mr Oman has so well observed, the Norman horse might
have surged for ever 'around the impenetrable shield-wall'.<a id="footnotetagbh139" name="footnotetagbh139"></a><a href="#footnotebh139"><sup>139</sup></a>
It was only, as he and Mr Hunt<a id="footnotetagbh140" name="footnotetagbh140"></a><a href="#footnotebh140"><sup>140</sup></a>
have shown, by the skilful combination
of horsemen and archers, by the maddening showers of
arrows between the charges of the horse, that the English, especially
the lighter armed, were stung into breaking their formation and
abandoning that passive defence to which they were unfortunately
restricted. 'While no mode of array could be stronger so long as the
line remained unbroken, it made it hard to form the line again.'<a id="footnotetagbh141" name="footnotetagbh141"></a><a href="#footnotebh141"><sup>141</sup></a>
Dazzled by the rapid movements of their foes, now advancing, now
retreating, either in feint or in earnest, the English, in places, broke
their line, and then the Duke, as Mr Oman writes, 'thrust his horsemen
into the gaps'.<a id="footnotetagbh142" name="footnotetagbh142"></a><a href="#footnotebh142"><sup>142</sup></a>
All this is quite certain, and is what the
authorities plainly describe. Let us, then, keep to what we know. Is
it not enough for us to picture the English line stubbornly striving
to the last to close its broken ranks, the awful scene of slaughter and
confusion, as the Old Guard of Harold, tortured by Norman arrows,
found the horsemen among them at last, slashing and piercing right
and left. Still the battle-axe blindly smote; doggedly, grimly still
they fought, till the axes dropped from their lifeless grasp. And so
they fell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>[pg 300]</span></p>

<p>Mr Archer, when he first came forward to defend 'Mr Freeman's
account of the great battle',<a id="footnotetagbh143" name="footnotetagbh143"></a><a href="#footnotebh143"><sup>143</sup></a>
observed that I claimed 'here to prove the entire inadequacy of Mr Freeman's work', that I held him
'wrong, completely wrong in his whole conception of the battle'.<a id="footnotetagbh144" name="footnotetagbh144"></a><a href="#footnotebh144"><sup>144</sup></a>
And he admitted that</p>

<blockquote><p>
'such a contention, it will at once be perceived, is very different from any
mere criticism of detail; it affects the centre and the very heart of Mr Freeman's
work. If he could blunder here in the most carefully elaborated passage
of his whole history, he could blunder anywhere; his reputation for accuracy
would be gone almost beyond hope of retrieving it' (p. 336).
</p></blockquote>

<p>'Blunder', surely, is a harsh word. I would rather say that the
historian is seen here at his strongest and at his weakest: at his
weakest in his tendency to follow blindly individual authorities in
turn, instead of grasping them as a whole, and, worse still, in
adapting them, at need, to his own preconceived notions; at his
strongest, in his Homeric power of making the actors in his drama
live and move before us. Not in vain has 'the wand of the enchanter',
as an ardent admirer once termed it, been waved around Harold
and his host. We are learning from recent German researches how
the narratives of early Irish warfare are 'perfectly surrounded with
magic'; how, for instance, at the battle of Culdreimne 'a Druid
wove a magic hedge, which he placed before the army as a hindrance
to the enemy'. But spells are now no longer wrought</p>

<div class="poem width21">  <div class="stanza">
<p>With woven paces and with waving hands;</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>and the Druid's hedge must go the way of our own magician's
'palisade'.</p>

<p>But, as I foresaw, in his eagerness to prove, at least, the existence
of a palisade, my critic was soon reduced to impugning Mr Freeman's
own supreme authority, and at last to throwing over Mr
Freeman himself. 'Incidit in Scyllam cupiens vitare Charybdim.'
Sneering<a id="footnotetagbh145" name="footnotetagbh145"></a><a href="#footnotebh145"><sup>145</sup></a>
at what the historian termed his 'highest', his 'primary'
authority, that 'precious monument', the Bayeux Tapestry&mdash;merely
because it will not square with his views&mdash;he rejects utterly
Mr Freeman's theory as to its date and origin,<a id="footnotetagbh146" name="footnotetagbh146"></a><a href="#footnotebh146"><sup>146</sup></a>
and substitutes one
which the Professor described as 'utterly inconceivable'.<a id="footnotetagbh147" name="footnotetagbh147"></a><a href="#footnotebh147"><sup>147</sup></a> He
has further informed us that 'common sense' tells him that the
English axemen cannot possibly have fought 'in the close array of
the shield-wall', as Mr Freeman says they did.<a id="footnotetagbh148" name="footnotetagbh148"></a><a href="#footnotebh148"><sup>148</sup></a>
And then he finally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>[pg 301]</span>
demolishes Mr Freeman's 'conception of the battle' by dismissing 'an
imaginary shield-wall',<a id="footnotetagbh149" name="footnotetagbh149"></a><a href="#footnotebh149"><sup>149</sup></a>
and assuring us that the absurd vision of
'an extended shield-wall vanishes like smoke'.<a id="footnotetagbh150" name="footnotetagbh150"></a><a href="#footnotebh150"><sup>150</sup></a></p>

<p>It is impossible not to pity Mr Freeman's would-be champion.
Scorning, at the outset, the thought that his hero could err 'in the
most carefully elaborated passage of his whole history',<a id="footnotetagbh151" name="footnotetagbh151"></a><a href="#footnotebh151"><sup>151</sup></a> his
attitude of bold defiance was a joy to Mr Freeman's friends.<a id="footnotetagbh152" name="footnotetagbh152"></a><a href="#footnotebh152"><sup>152</sup></a></p>

</div></div>

<p>But his wildly brandished weapon proved more deadly to friend
than foe: he discovered, as I knew, he could only oppose me by
making jettison of Mr Freeman's views. Of this we have seen above
examples striking enough; but the climax was reached in his chief
contention, namely, that the lines in the <cite>Roman de Rou</cite>, which
describe, Mr Freeman asserted, 'the array of the shield-wall',<a id="footnotetagbh153" name="footnotetagbh153"></a><a href="#footnotebh153"><sup>153</sup></a>
cannot, on many grounds, be 'referred to a shield-wall'.<a id="footnotetagbh154" name="footnotetagbh154"></a><a href="#footnotebh154"><sup>154</sup></a>
No contradiction could be more complete. So he now finds himself
forced to write:</p>

<blockquote><p>
I do not say&mdash;I have <em>never</em> said&mdash;that I agree with every word that Mr
Freeman has written about the great battle; but I do regard his account of
Hastings as the noblest battle-piece in our historical literature&mdash;perhaps in
that of the world.<a id="footnotetagbh155" name="footnotetagbh155"></a><a href="#footnotebh155"><sup>155</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>'O most lame and impotent conclusion!' We are discussing
whether that account is 'right', not whether it is 'noble'. To the
splendour of that narrative I have borne no sparing witness. I have
spoken of its 'superb vividness', I have praised its 'epic grandeur', I
have dwelt on the writer's 'Homeric power of making the actors in
his drama live and move before us', and have compared his tale with
the 'glorious description' in the saga of Stamfordbridge. But the
nearer it approaches to the epic and the saga, the less likely is that
stirring tale to be rigidly confined to fact.</p>

<p>I will not say of Mr Archer, 'his attack must be held to have
failed', for that would imperfectly express its utter and absolute collapse.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>[pg 302]</span>
The whole of my original argument as to the narrative of the
battle remains not merely unshaken, but, it will be seen, untouched.
Mr Archer himself has now pleaded that 'the only' point he 'took up
directly' was that of the disputed passage in Wace;<a id="footnotetagbh156" name="footnotetagbh156"></a><a href="#footnotebh156"><sup>156</sup></a>
and here he could only make even the semblance of a case by deliberately ignoring
and suppressing Mr Freeman's own verdict (iii. 763-4), to
which, from the very first, I have persistently referred. In his latest,
as in his earliest article, he adheres to this deliberate suppression, and
falsely represents 'Mr Freeman's interpretation' as 'a palisade or
barricade' alone.<a id="footnotetagbh157" name="footnotetagbh157"></a><a href="#footnotebh157"><sup>157</sup></a></p>

<p>Those who may object to plain speaking should rather denounce
the tactics that make such speaking necessary. When my adversary
claims that his case is proved, if the disputed passage does not describe
a shield-wall, he is perfectly aware that Mr Freeman distinctly
asserted that it did. To suppress that fact, as Mr Archer does,<a id="footnotetagbh158" name="footnotetagbh158"></a><a href="#footnotebh158"><sup>158</sup></a>
can only be described as dishonest.</p>

<p>Judging from the desperate tactics to which my opponent resorted,
it would seem that my 'attack' on Mr Freeman's work cannot
here be impugned by any straightforward means. The impotent
wrath aroused by its success will lead, no doubt, to other attempts
equally unscrupulous and equally futile. But truth cannot be
silenced, facts cannot be obscured. I appeal, sure of my ground, to
the verdict of historical scholars, awaiting, with confidence and
calm, the inevitable triumph of the truth.</p>

<h4>CONCLUSION<a name="page302a" id="page302a"></a></h4>

<p>'History is philosophy teaching by examples.' In one sense the
period of the Conquest was, as Mr Freeman asserted in his preface,
'a period of our history which is full alike of political instruction and
of living personal interest'. In one sense, it is an object-lesson never
more urgently needed than it is at the present hour. Only that lesson
is one which Mr Freeman could never teach, because it is the
bitterest commentary on the doctrines he most adored. In the hands
of a patriot, in the hands of a writer who placed England before
party, the tale might have burned like a beacon-fire, warning us that
what happened in the past, might happen now, today. The Battle of
Hastings has its moral and its moral is for us. An almost anarchical
excess of liberty, the want of a strong centralized system, the absorption
in party strife, the belief that politics are statesmanship, and
that oratory will save a people&mdash;these are the dangers of which it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>[pg 303]</span>
warns us, and to which the majority of Englishmen are subject now
as then. But Mr Freeman, like the Bourbons, never learnt, and never
forgot. A democrat first, an historian afterwards, History was for
him, unhappily, ever 'past politics'. If he worshipped Harold with a
blind enthusiasm, it was chiefly because he was a <i>novus homo</i>, 'who
reigned purely by the will of the people'. He insisted that the English,
on the hill of battle, were beaten through lack of discipline, through
lack of obedience to their king; but he could not see that the system
in which he gloried, a system which made the people 'a co-ordinate
authority' with their king, was the worst of all trainings for the hour
of battle; he could not see that, like Poland, England fell, in large
measure, from the want of a strong rule, and from excess of liberty.
To him the voice of 'a sovereign people' was 'the most spirit-stirring
of earthly sounds'; but it availed about as much to check the Norman
Conquest as the fetish of an African savage, or the yells of Asiatic
hordes. We trace in his history of Sicily the same blindness to fact.
Dionysius was for him, as he was for Dante, merely&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem width18">  <div class="stanza">
<p class="i10">Dionisio fero</p>
<p>Che fe' Cicilia aver dolorosi anni.</p>
</div></div>

<p>But, in truth, the same excess of liberty that left England a prey to
the Normans had left Sicily, in her day, a prey to Carthage: the same
internal jealousies paralysed her strength. And yet he could not forgive
Dionysius, the man who gave Sicily what she lacked, the rule of
a 'strong man armed', because, in a democrat's eyes, Dionysius was
a 'tyrant'. That I am strictly just in my criticism of Mr Freeman's
attitude at the Conquest, is, I think, abundantly manifest, when
even so ardent a democrat as Mr Grant Allen admits that</p>

<blockquote><p>
a people so helpless, so utterly anarchic, so incapable of united action,
deserved to undergo a severe training from the hard task-masters of Romance
civilization. The nation remained, but it remained as a conquered
race, to be drilled in the stern school of the conquerors.<a id="footnotetagbh159" name="footnotetagbh159"></a><a href="#footnotebh159"><sup>159</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Such were the bitter fruits of Old-English freedom. And, in the
teeth of this awful lesson, Mr Freeman could still look back with
longing to 'a free and pure Teutonic England',<a id="footnotetagbh160" name="footnotetagbh160"></a><a href="#footnotebh160"><sup>160</sup></a>
could still exult in
the thought that a democratic age is bringing England ever nearer
to her state 'before the Norman set foot upon her shores'.</p>

<p>But the school of which he was a champion has long seen its day.
A reactionary movement, as has been pointed out by scholars in
America, as in Russia<a id="footnotetagbh161" name="footnotetagbh161"></a><a href="#footnotebh161"><sup>161</sup></a>
has invaded the study of history, has
assailed the supremacy of the Liberal school, and has begun to
preach, as the teaching of the past, the dangers of unfettered freedom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>[pg 304]</span></p>

<p>Politics are not statesmanship. Mr Freeman confused the two.
There rang from his successor a truer note when, as he traversed the
seas that bind the links of the Empire, he penned those words that
appeal to the sons of an imperial race, sunk in the strife of parties or
the politics of a parish pump, to rise to the level of their high inheritance
among the nations of the earth. What was the Empire, what
was India&mdash;we all remember that historic phrase&mdash;to one whose
ideal, it would seem, of statesmanship, was that of an orator in Hyde
Park? Godwine, the ambitious, the unscrupulous agitator, is always
for him 'the great deliverer'. Whether in the Sicily of the 'tyrants', or
the England of Edward the Confessor, we are presented, under the
guise of history, with a glorification of demagogy.</p>

<blockquote><p>
No man ever deserved a higher or a more lasting place in national gratitude
than the first man who, being neither King nor Priest, stands forth in
English history as endowed with all the highest attributes of the statesman.
In him, in those distant times, we can revere the great minister, the unrivalled
parliamentary leader, the man who could sway councils and
assemblies at his will, etc., etc.<a id="footnotetagbh162" name="footnotetagbh162"></a><a href="#footnotebh162"><sup>162</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>We know of whom the writer was thinking, when he praised that
'irresistible tongue';<a id="footnotetagbh163" name="footnotetagbh163"></a><a href="#footnotebh163"><sup>163</sup></a>
he had surely before him a living model, who,
if not a statesman, was, no doubt, an 'unrivalled parliamentary
leader'. Do we not recognize the portrait?&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
The mighty voice, the speaking look and gesture of that old man eloquent,
could again sway assemblies of Englishmen at his will.<a id="footnotetagbh164" name="footnotetagbh164"></a><a href="#footnotebh164"><sup>164</sup></a></p>

<p>The voice which had so often swayed assemblies of Englishmen, was heard
once more in all the fulness of its eloquence.<a id="footnotetagbh165" name="footnotetagbh165"></a><a href="#footnotebh165"><sup>165</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>But it was not an 'irresistible tongue', nor 'the harangue of a practised
orator', of which England stood in need. Forts and soldiers, not
tongues, are England's want now as then. But to the late Regius
Professor, if there was one thing more hateful than 'castles', more
hateful even than hereditary rule, it was a standing army. When the
Franco-German war had made us look to our harness, he set himself
at once, with superb blindness, to sneer at what he termed 'the
panic', to suggest the application of democracy to the army, and to
express his characteristic aversion to the thought of 'an officer and a
gentleman'.<a id="footnotetagbh166" name="footnotetagbh166"></a><a href="#footnotebh166"><sup>166</sup></a>
How could such a writer teach the lesson of the
Norman Conquest?</p>

<p>'The long, long canker of peace' had done its work&mdash;'vivebatur
enim tunc pene ubique in Anglia perditis moribus, et pro pacis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>[pg 305]</span>
affluentia deliciarum fervebat luxus.'<a id="footnotetagbh167" name="footnotetagbh167"></a><a href="#footnotebh167"><sup>167</sup></a>
The land was ripe for the
invader, and a saviour of Society was at hand. While our fathers
were playing at democracy, watching the strife of rival houses, as
men might now watch the contest of rival parties, the terrible Duke
of the Normans was girding himself for war. <i>De nobis fabula narratur.</i></p>

probably be traced 'to the seaside associations of the name Hastings'. Unfortunately
for him, Mr Freeman himself had quoted this wild story (iii. 729) and suggested
quite a different explanation, namely, that it originated, not in the Battle of
Hastings, but in some real 'naval operations'.</p>

lest I should be charged with ignoring any defence of Mr Freeman, I will briefly
explain in this note the attitude adopted by his champions.</p>

<p class="footnote">In the <cite>Contemporary Review</cite> of March 1893, Mr T. A. Archer produced a reply
to my original article (<cite>Quarterly Review</cite>, July 1892), or rather, to that part of it
which dealt with the Battle of Hastings. Declaring my attack on the palisade to be
my 'only definite and palpable charge against Mr Freeman's account' (p. 273)
which, it will be found, is not the case&mdash;he undertook to 'show Mr Freeman to
have been entirely right in the view he took of the whole question' (p. 267). To do
this, he deliberately suppressed the fatal passage (iii. 763-4) I have printed above&mdash;to
which, in my article, I had prominently appealed&mdash;in order to represent me as
alone in seeing a description of the shield-wall in Wace's lines (p. 267). He then
insisted that 'there are six distinct objections to translating this passage as if it
referred to a shield-wall' (p. 270).</p>

<p class="footnote">Instantly reminded by me (<cite>Athen&aelig;um</cite>, March 18, April 8, 1893), that Mr
Freeman himself had taken it as a description of the shield-wall, and challenged
to account for the fact, again charged (<cite>Quarterly Review</cite>, July 1893, p. 88), with
'ignoring a fact in the presence of which his elaborate argument collapses like a
house of cards', further challenged (<cite>Academy</cite>, September 16, 1893) to reconcile
Mr Freeman's words (iii. 763-4), with his representation of the historian's position,
Mr Archer continued to shirk the point, till in the <cite>English Historical Review</cite> of
January 1894, he grudgingly confessed that 'the discovery that a shield-wall (of
some sort or other) was implied in this so-called "crucial passage", is due to Mr
Freeman' (p. 3), but he and Miss Norgate endeavoured to urge that it could not
be as I imagined, the shield-wall that he had always spoken of (pp. 3, 16, 62).
Even this feeble evasion, now seems to be dropped since I disposed of it (<cite>Ibid.</cite>,
225-7).</p>

No one, of course, would treat the Tapestry like a modern illustrated journal;
but if it be fairly treated, in Mr Freeman's spirit, one's real wonder is that, under
such obvious limitations, the designer should have been so successful as he has.
Nowhere, perhaps, is the painstaking accuracy of the Bayeux Tapestry better seen
than in its miniature representation of the fortress at Dinan. It shows us the <i>motte</i>,
or artificial mound, surrounded by its ditch, and even the bank beyond the ditch,
together with the wooden bridge springing (as we know it did in such castles)
from that bank to the summit of the mound.</p>

<p class="footnote">As to Mr Archer's attempts to show that Mr Freeman in one or two instances
did not value so highly as he did what he deemed the supreme authority for the
battle, I need only print Mr Freeman's words, parallel with his own comments,
to show how their character is distorted.</p>

I wish, as I have done throughout, to make it absolutely clear that I am here
concerned only with Mr Freeman's rendering of Wace. If we are to go outside that
rendering and discuss Wace <i>de novo</i>, it is best to do so in a fresh section. This I
hope to do below, when I shall discuss the question of his authority (which has
not yet arisen), and shall also propound my own explanation of the now famous
disputed passage.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="footnotebh41" name="footnotebh41"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotetagbh41"><sup>41</sup></a>
In my first article (<cite>Quarterly Review</cite>, July 1892, pp. 15-16) I pointed out that the
great weight attached to Mr Freeman's statements had of course 'secured universal
acceptance' for the palisade, and that it figures 'now in every history'. Mr Archer,
in his latest paper, refers to these remarks (<cite>English Historical Review</cite>, ix. 602) and
triumphantly charges me with self-contradiction in having myself once accepted it,
like every one else. He refers to an incidental allusion by me in the <cite>Dictionary of National Biography</cite>
so many years ago that I was unaware of its existence. I am particularly
glad to be reminded of the fact that I did allude, in early days, to the
'palisade' and to 'Senlac', for it emphasizes the very point of my case, namely, that
that mischievous superstition of Mr Freeman's unfailing accuracy must be ruthlessly
destroyed lest others should be taught, as I was, to accept his authority as
supreme.</p>

<p class="footnote">My opponent writes:</p>

<p class="footnote3c">'Mr Round ... in direct contradiction to the <cite>Quarterly</cite> reviewer, has found for it
[the palisade] an authority in William of Poitiers, and <i>has gone far beyond Mr Freeman
himself in giving us the name of the man who first broke it down</i>.'</p>

<p class="footnote">How has Mr Archer produced the alleged 'contradiction'? He has taken a
passage from my notice of Robert de Beaumont, written years before I had made
any independent investigation of the Battle of Hastings, and when I thought, like
the rest of the world, that I might, here at any rate, safely follow Mr Freeman,
when it was only a matter of a passing allusion to the fight. The following parallel
passages will prove, beyond the shadow of doubt, that I here merely followed Mr
Freeman, accepting his own authority&mdash;William of Poitiers&mdash;for the incident. Any
one in my place would have done the same. But Mr Archer asserts that, on the
contrary, I went 'far beyond Mr Freeman himself in giving us the name of the
man who first broke it down'. Let us see if this definite statement is true:

It is no less interesting than curious that the Bayeux Tapestry enables us to
see how the archers were combined with the mailed knights at the Battle of the
Standard. It shows us (on its principle of giving a type) an English archer of whom
Mr Freeman has well observed: 'He is a small man without armour crouching
under the shield of a tall Housecarl, like Teukros under that of Aias' (iii. 472).
So &AElig;thelred writes that the mailed warriors 'sagittarios ita sibi inseruerunt ut,

historians: instead of examining, as I did, Baudri's account in detail he dismisses it

<cite>Norm. Conq.</cite>, iii. 462. I regret that I must call attention to the fact that I gave
(<cite>English Historical Review</cite>, ix. 250) this precise reference for my statement that,
according to Mr Freeman, the infantry were all archers, explaining that in another
passage (p. 467) William of Poitiers had led him to take a somewhat different view.
Mr Archer, however, has printed (<cite>English Historical Review</cite>, ix. 603) the other passage
(p. 467) in triumph by the side of my statement. He further denies that Mr Freeman
held, even on p. 462, that the infantry were all archers. Anyone can test the
value of Mr Archer's denial for himself by referring to <cite>Norm. Conq.</cite>, iii. 462, where
he will find that Mr Freeman, describing the Norman host, mentions no infantry
but archers.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="footnotebh114" name="footnotebh114"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotetagbh114"><sup>114</sup></a>
As he had merely copied from the Tapestry on p. 462, so he copied William

The distinction between archers and crossbowmen is of little or no consequence,
the missile being common to both.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="footnotebh116" name="footnotebh116"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotetagbh116"><sup>116</sup></a>
My opponents complain that in the former passage Mr Freeman assigns this
task to 'the heavier foot' only; but my point is that no palisade is here mentioned,
and no attack on it by <em>any</em> infantry, heavy or light, and no weapons assigned to
that infantry of any use for the purpose.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="footnotebh117" name="footnotebh117"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotetagbh117"><sup>117</sup></a>
This is an excellent instance of what I said as to Mr Freeman's 'imaginary'
references to the now famous palisade. I have challenged my opponents to disprove
my statement that none of Mr Freeman's own authorities says anything here
of a palisade. And, of course, they cannot do so.</p>

<p class="footnote">Here is another instance in point. We read on pp. 486-7 that Robert of Beaumont
was specially distinguished in the work of breaking down the 'barricade' (see also
<i>supra</i>, p. 273). But when we turn to William of Poitiers, the authority cited, we
find no mention of a 'barricade', but read only of him 'irruens ac sternens magn&acirc;
cum audaci&acirc;'. As the writer had just described how the Duke '<i>stravit</i> adversam
gentem', we see that Robert, in his charge, laid low, not a barricade, but 'adversam
gentem'.</p>

<p class="footnote">This brings me to an extraordinary case of mediaeval plagiarism. The author of
the Ely history has applied this description of Robert's exploits to the Conqueror
himself at Ely (<cite>Liber Eliensis</cite>, pp. 244-5). The passages 'Exardentes Normanni&mdash;deleverunt
ea', 'Egit enim quod&mdash;magna cum audacia', 'Scriptor Thebaidos vel
&AElig;neidos', <i>et seq.</i>, are all 'lifted' bodily from William's narrative of the Battle of
Hastings and applied to the storming of the Isle of Ely!</p>

<p>In discussing Mr Freeman's treatment of the great battle, we saw
that the only passage he vouched for the existence of a palisade<a id="footnotetagmw1" name="footnotetagmw1"></a><a href="#footnotemw1"><sup>1</sup></a>
consisted of certain lines from Wace's <cite>Roman de Rou</cite>, which he ultimately
declared to be, on the contrary, a description of 'the array of
the shield-wall'.<a id="footnotetagmw2" name="footnotetagmw2"></a><a href="#footnotemw2"><sup>2</sup></a>
The question, therefore, as to their meaning&mdash;on
which my critics have throughout endeavoured to represent the controversy
as turning&mdash;did not even arise so far as Mr Freeman was
concerned. Still less had I occasion to discuss the authority of Wace,
Mr Freeman's explicit verdict on the lines (iii. 763-4) having removed
them, as concerns his own narrative, from the sphere of
controversy.</p>

<p>The case, however, is at once altered when Mr Archer insists on
ignoring Mr Freeman's words, and makes an independent examination
of the lines, quoting also other passages which were not vouched
by Mr Freeman, as proving 'beyond the shadow of a doubt that
Wace did mean to represent the English at Hastings as fighting behind
a palisade'.<a id="footnotetagmw3" name="footnotetagmw3"></a><a href="#footnotemw3"><sup>3</sup></a>
So long as I make it clearly understood that this
question in no way affects the controversy as to Mr Freeman, I am
quite willing to discuss the question thus raised by Mr Archer.</p>

<p>It is most naturally treated under these three heads:</p>

<p>(1) Did Wace believe and assert that there was a palisade?</p>

<p>(2) If so, what weight ought to be attached to his authority?</p>

<p>(3) If we reject it, can we explain how his mistake arose?</p>

<h4>WACE'S MEANING<a name="page306a" id="page306a"></a></h4>

<p>I have elsewhere<a id="footnotetagmw4" name="footnotetagmw4"></a><a href="#footnotemw4"><sup>4</sup></a>
discussed 'the disputed passage' (<i>supra</i>, p. 267),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>[pg 307]</span>
and agreed with Mr Archer that there are 'four views which have
been suggested' as to its meaning.<a id="footnotetagmw5" name="footnotetagmw5"></a><a href="#footnotemw5"><sup>5</sup></a>
Two of them, I there showed,
were successively held by Mr Freeman, and the two others successively
advanced by Mr Archer. When I add (anticipating) that,
according to M. Paris, 'le passage de Wace pr&eacute;sente quelque
obscurit&eacute;',<a id="footnotetagmw6" name="footnotetagmw6"></a><a href="#footnotemw6"><sup>6</sup></a>
and that M. Meyer introduced yet another element of
doubt in a special kind of shield ('de grands &eacute;cus') not previously
suggested, it will be obvious, quite apart from any opinion of my
own, that the passage presents difficulties.</p>

<p>So long as I only dealt with Mr Freeman's work, I found on his
admission that the passage described the shield-wall.<a id="footnotetagmw7" name="footnotetagmw7"></a><a href="#footnotemw7"><sup>7</sup></a>
Now that we are leaving his work aside, I fall back on my own conclusion,
namely, that the passage is with equal difficulty referred either to a
palisade or to a shield-wall. The word 'escuz', it will be seen, occurs
twice in the passage. Mr Archer held, at first, that in neither case
did it mean real 'shields',<a id="footnotetagmw8" name="footnotetagmw8"></a><a href="#footnotemw8"><sup>8</sup></a>
but he afterwards assigned that meaning
to the second of the two 'escuz', while still rendering the first 'in a
metaphorical sense'.<a id="footnotetagmw9" name="footnotetagmw9"></a><a href="#footnotemw9"><sup>9</sup></a>
It is obvious that when Mr Freeman took the
lines to describe 'the array of the shield-wall', he must have done so
on the ground that 'escuz' meant 'shields'. That is my own contention.
While fully recognizing the obstacles to translating 'the disputed
passage' as if it referred throughout to a shield-wall, I maintain
that 'escu' means shield, as a term 'which is one of the commonest in
Wace' and invariably means shield.<a id="footnotetagmw10" name="footnotetagmw10"></a><a href="#footnotemw10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>But to cut short a long story, it was decided by Mr Gardiner to
settle this issue by submitting the disputed passage to the verdict of
MM. Gaston Paris and Paul Meyer. In spite of my protest, this was
done without my articles and my solution of the problem<a id="footnotetagmw11" name="footnotetagmw11"></a><a href="#footnotemw11"><sup>11</sup></a>
being laid before them at the same time. A snap verdict was thus
secured before they had seen the evidence. I am sure that Mr
Gardiner must have thought this fair, and editors, we know,
cannot err; but it seems to me quite possible that these distinguished
French scholars were not familiar with the shield-wall, an Old English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>[pg 308]</span>
tactic, and were not aware that this information was the
great feature of the battle. Had all this, as I wished, been duly set
before them, their verdict would, of course, have carried much
greater weight.</p>

<p>But having said this much, I frankly admit that their verdict is in
favour of Mr Archer's contention, and, so far as the first 'escuz' is
concerned, against my own.<a id="footnotetagmw12" name="footnotetagmw12"></a><a href="#footnotemw12"><sup>12</sup></a>
They may not agree in detail with
each other, or with either of Mr Archer's views, but, on the broad
issue, he has a perfect right to claim that their verdict is for him so
long as he does not pretend that it also confirms 'Mr Freeman's
interpretation', by ignoring the historian's own latest and explicit
words.<a id="footnotetagmw13" name="footnotetagmw13"></a><a href="#footnotemw13"><sup>13</sup></a>
It must also be remembered that this admission in no way
diminishes the obscurity of the passage, which, as we have seen, is
beyond dispute, and which forms an important element in my own
solution of the problem.<a id="footnotetagmw14" name="footnotetagmw14"></a><a href="#footnotemw14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>Having now shown how the matter stands with regard to 'the
disputed passage', I need not linger over those which Mr Freeman
ignored, and which Mr Archer adduced to strengthen his views as
to the main passage. I have dealt with these elsewhere,<a id="footnotetagmw15" name="footnotetagmw15"></a><a href="#footnotemw15"><sup>15</sup></a>
and need here only refer to ll. 8585-90, because that passage raises a point of
historical interest quite apart from personal controversy. I have
maintained that it can only be accepted at the cost of 'throwing over
Mr Freeman's conception of the battle',<a id="footnotetagmw16" name="footnotetagmw16"></a><a href="#footnotemw16"><sup>16</sup></a>
and have proved, by quoting his own words, that he placed the standard with Harold at
his foot 'in the very forefront of the fight'.<a id="footnotetagmw17" name="footnotetagmw17"></a><a href="#footnotemw17"><sup>17</sup></a>
I do not say that he was right in doing so: he was, I think, very probably wrong, and was influenced
here, as elsewhere, by his dramatic treatment of Harold.
But as this can only be matter of opinion, I have not challenged his
view; I only say that those who accept it cannot consistently appeal
to a passage in Wace which places the standard in the rear of the
English host.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>[pg 309]</span></p>

<h4>WACE'S AUTHORITY</h4>

<p>Assuming then, for the sake of argument, that Wace mentions a
defence of some kind,<a id="footnotetagmw18" name="footnotetagmw18"></a><a href="#footnotemw18"><sup>18</sup></a>
even though not consistently<a id="footnotetagmw19" name="footnotetagmw19"></a><a href="#footnotemw19"><sup>19</sup></a>
in front of the English troops, let us see whether his statement is corroborated,
whether it is in harmony with the other evidence, and whether, if it
is neither corroborated nor in such agreement, his authority is
sufficient, nevertheless, to warrant its acceptance.</p>

<p>As to corroboration, Mr Archer undertook 'to produce corroborative
evidence from other sources';<a id="footnotetagmw20" name="footnotetagmw20"></a><a href="#footnotemw20"><sup>20</sup></a>
but this at once dwindled down to one line&mdash;'tending in the same direction'<a id="footnotetagmw21" name="footnotetagmw21"></a><a href="#footnotemw21"><sup>21</sup></a>&mdash;
from Beno&icirc;t de St Maur, who does not even mention a palisade.<a id="footnotetagmw22" name="footnotetagmw22"></a><a href="#footnotemw22"><sup>22</sup></a>
There is therefore, on his own showing, not a shred of corroborative evidence.</p>

<p>As to the second point, I may refer to my arguments against the
palisade,<a id="footnotetagmw23" name="footnotetagmw23"></a><a href="#footnotemw23"><sup>23</sup></a>
where I showed that none of our authorities is here in agreement with Wace.</p>

<p>We come, therefore, to our third point, namely, the weight to
which Wace's testimony, when standing alone, is entitled. Here, as
elsewhere, I adhere to my position. As I have written in the
<cite>Quarterly Review</cite>:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Even if Wace, clearly and consistently, mentioned a palisade throughout
his account of the battle, we should certainly reject the statement of a witness,
writing a century after it, when we find him at variance with every
authority (for that is our point), just as Mr Freeman rejected the bridge at
Varaville,<a id="footnotetagmw24" name="footnotetagmw24"></a><a href="#footnotemw24"><sup>24</sup></a>
or the 'falsehood' of the burning of the ships, or the 'blunder' of
making the Duke land at Hastings, or his anachronisms, or his chronology.
For, 'of course', in the Professor's own words, 'whenever he [Wace] departs
from contemporary authority, and merely sets down floating traditions
nearly a hundred years after the latest events which he records, his statements
need to be very carefully weighed'.<a id="footnotetagmw25" name="footnotetagmw25"></a><a href="#footnotemw25"><sup>25</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>[pg 310]</span></p>

<p>Let me specially lay stress upon the points on which, when
Wace and the Tapestry differ, the preference is given by Mr Freeman
himself to the Tapestry as against Wace:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Had the tapestry been a work of later date, it is hardly possible that it
could have given the simple and truthful account of these matters which it
does give. A work of the twelfth or thirteenth century<a id="footnotetagmw26" name="footnotetagmw26"></a><a href="#footnotemw26"><sup>26</sup></a>
would have brought in, <i>as even honest Wace does in some degree</i>, the notions of the twelfth or thirteenth
century. One cannot conceive an artist of the time of Henry II, still less an
artist later than the French conquest of Normandy, agreeing so remarkably
with the authentic writings of the eleventh century (iii. 573).</p>

<p>[In the Tapestry] every antiquarian detail is accurate&mdash;the lack of
armour on the horses (iii. 574). [But] Wace speaks of the horse of William
fitz Osbern as 'all covered with iron' (iii. 570).
</p></blockquote>

<p>Wace again, is 'hardly accurate' (iii. 765), we read, as to the
English weapons, because he differs from the Tapestry. As to
Harold's wound, 'Wace places it too early in the battle' (iii. 497);
Mr Freeman follows the Tapestry. As to the landing of the Normans
at Pevensey:</p>

<blockquote><p>
<i>Venit ad Pevenes&aelig;</i>, says the Tapestry ... Wace ... altogether reverses the
geography, making the army land at Hastings, and go to Pevensey afterwards'
(iii. 402).
</p></blockquote>

<p>As to the 'Mora', the Duke's ship, the Tapestry shows 'the child
with his horn'; Wace describes him 'Saete et arc tendu portant'.
Mr Freeman adopts the 'horn' (iii. 382). Harold, says Mr Freeman,
was imprisoned at Beaurain.</p>

<blockquote><p>
This is quite plain from the Tapestry: 'Dux eum ad Belrem et ibi eum
tenuit'. Wace says, 'A Abevile l'ont men&eacute;....' This I conceive to arise from
a misconception of the words of William of Jumi&egrave;ges (iii. 224).
</p></blockquote>

<p>This illustrates, I would remind Mr Archer, the difference between
a primary authority and a mere late compiler.</p>

<p>To these examples I may add Wace's mention of Harold's <i>vizor</i>
(<i>ventaille</i>). Mr Freeman pointed out the superior accuracy of the
Tapestry in 'the nose-pieces' (iii. 574), and observed that 'the
vizor' was a much later introduction (iii. 497).<a id="footnotetagmw27" name="footnotetagmw27"></a><a href="#footnotemw27"><sup>27</sup></a>
Here again we see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311"></a>[pg 311]</span>
the soundness of Mr Freeman's view that Wace could not help
introducing 'the notions' of his own time into his account of the
battle. Miss Norgate admits that he 'transferred to his mythical
battles the colouring of the actual battles of his own day', but urges
that these narratives illustrate the 'warfare of Wace's own ...
contemporaries'.<a id="footnotetagmw28" name="footnotetagmw28"></a><a href="#footnotemw28"><sup>28</sup></a>
Quite so. But the battle of Hastings belonged to
an older and obsolete style of warfare. That is what his champions
always forget. If Miss Norgate's argument has any meaning, it is
that the men who fought in that battle were 'Wace's own contemporaries'.</p>

<p>But, even where Wace's authority is in actual agreement with the
Tapestry, Mr Freeman did not hesitate to reject, or rather, ignore it,
as we saw in the matter of the fosse disaster.</p>

<p>As to Wace's sources of information, and the <i>prima facie</i> evidence
for his authority, a question of considerable interest is raised. Mr
Archer discusses it from his own standpoint.<a id="footnotetagmw29" name="footnotetagmw29"></a><a href="#footnotemw29"><sup>29</sup></a>
On Wace's life, age and work, facts are few and speculations many. These have been
collected and patiently sifted in Andresen's great work, with the
following result:</p>

<p>Wace was certainly living not merely in 1170,<a id="footnotetagmw30" name="footnotetagmw30"></a><a href="#footnotemw30"><sup>30</sup></a>
but in 1174, for he alludes to the siege of Rouen (August 1174) in his epilogue to the
second part of the 'Roman'.<a id="footnotetagmw31" name="footnotetagmw31"></a><a href="#footnotemw31"><sup>31</sup></a>
It is admitted on all hands, though
Mr Archer does not mention it, that he did not even begin the
third part till after the coronation of the younger Henry (June 14,
1170).<a id="footnotetagmw32" name="footnotetagmw32"></a><a href="#footnotemw32"><sup>32</sup></a>
Allowing for its great length, he cannot have come to his
account of the battle <em>at the very earliest</em> till 1171, 105 years after the
event. For my part, I think that it was probably written even some
years later. But imagine in any case an Englishman, ignorant of
Belgium, writing an account of Waterloo, mainly <i>from oral tradition</i>,
in 1920.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page312" id="page312"></a>[pg 312]</span></p>

<p>Mr Archer contends that Wace was born 'probably between the
years 1100 and 1110' (<i>ante</i>, p. 31). Andresen holds that the earliest
date we can venture to assign is 1110,<a id="footnotetagmw33" name="footnotetagmw33"></a><a href="#footnotemw33"><sup>33</sup></a>
forty-four years after the battle. Special stress is laid by Mr Archer on Wace's oral information:</p>

<blockquote><p>
He had seen and talked with many men who recollected things anterior
to Hastings and the Hastings campaign. Among his informants for this latter
was his own father, then, we may suppose, a well-grown lad, if not an actual
participator in the fight (<i>ante</i>, p. 32).
</p></blockquote>

<p>'We may suppose'&mdash;where all is supposition&mdash;exactly the contrary.
If Wace was born, as we may safely say, more than forty years after
the battle, 'we may suppose' that his father was not even born
before it. All this talk about Wace's father is based on ll. 6445-7,
of which Andresen truly remarks, 'Die Verse "Mais co oi dire a
mon pere, Bien m'en souient mais Vaslet ere, Que set cenz nes,
quatre meins, furent", u.s.w., sind viel zu unbestimmt gehalten,
so dass wir aus ihnen streng genommen nicht einmal entnehmen
k&ouml;nnen, ob der Vater im Jahre 1066 schon auf der Welt war oder
nicht' (p. lxx). I venture to take my own case. Born within forty
years of Waterloo, I can say with Wace that I remember my father
telling me, as a boy, stories of the battle. But he was born after it.
The information was second-hand. Over and over again does Mr
Archer lay stress on the fact (<i>ut supra</i>) that Wace gives us 'the
reminiscences of the old heroes who fought at Hastings as no one else
has cared to do'.<a id="footnotetagmw34" name="footnotetagmw34"></a><a href="#footnotemw34"><sup>34</sup></a>
I must insist that Wace himself nowhere mentions
having seen or spoken to them. He does mention having seen men
who remembered the great comet (Mr Archer italicizes the lines<a id="footnotetagmw35" name="footnotetagmw35"></a><a href="#footnotemw35"><sup>35</sup></a>);
but this exactly confirms my point. For when Wace <i>had</i> seen eyewitnesses
he was careful, we see, to mention the fact. Men would
remember the comet, though little children at the time. One of my
own very earliest recollections is that of a great comet, even though
it did not create the sensation of the comet in 1066. Wace had talked
with those who had been children, not with those who had been
fighting men, in 1066.</p>

<p>I need only invite attention to one more point. Mr Archer assures
us that 'Wace is a very sober writer', with 'something of the shrewd
scepticism' of modern scholars.<a id="footnotetagmw36" name="footnotetagmw36"></a><a href="#footnotemw36"><sup>36</sup></a>
What shall we say then, of his long
story (ll. 7005-100) of the night visit, by Harold and Gyrth, to the
Norman camp, to which Mr Archer appeals as evidence for the
<i>lices</i> (l. 7010)? 'Nothing,' replies Mr Freeman (iii. 449), 'could be less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>[pg 313]</span>
trustworthy.... No power short of divination could have revealed
it.'<a id="footnotetagmw37" name="footnotetagmw37"></a><a href="#footnotemw37"><sup>37</sup></a>
Mr Archer tells us he has only space for one instance<a id="footnotetagmw38" name="footnotetagmw38"></a><a href="#footnotemw38"><sup>38</sup></a>
of Wace's conscientiousness. That instance is his story of the negotiation
between William and Baldwin of Flanders on the eve of the
Conquest. Of this story Mr Freeman writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Of the intercourse between William and Baldwin in his character of
sovereign of Flanders Wace has a tale which strikes me as so purely legendary
that I did not venture to introduce it into the text.... The whole story seems
quite inconsistent with the real relations between William and Baldwin
(iii. 718-19).
</p></blockquote>

<p>Comment is superfluous.</p>

<p>Having now shown that Wace's evidence is not corroborated, is
not in accordance with that of contemporary witnesses, and cannot
on the sound canons of criticism recognized by Mr Freeman himself,
be accepted under these circumstances, I propose to show that
my case can be carried further still, and that I can even trace to its
origin the confused statement in his 'disputed passage' which is said
to describe a palisade or defence of some sort or other.</p>

<h4>WACE AND HIS SOURCES<a id="footnotetagmw39" name="footnotetagmw39"></a><a href="#footnotemw39"><sup>39</sup></a><a name="page313a" id="page313a"></a></h4>

<p>In studying the authorities for the Battle of Hastings, I was led to a
conclusion which, so far as I know, had never occurred to any one.
It is that William of Malmesbury's 'Gesta Regum' was among the
sources used by Wace. Neither in Korting's elaborate treatise,
'Ueber die Quellen des Roman de Rou', nor in Andresen's notes to
his well-known edition of the 'Roman' (ii. 708), can I find any
suggestion to this effect. Dr Stubbs, in his edition of the 'Gesta
Regum', dwells on the popularity of the work both at home and
abroad, but does not include Wace among the writers who availed
themselves of it; and the late Mr Freeman, though frequently
compelled to notice the agreement between Wace and William,
never thought, it appears, of suggesting the theory of derivation;
indeed, he speaks of the two writers as independent witnesses, when
dealing with one of these coincidences.<a id="footnotetagmw40" name="footnotetagmw40"></a><a href="#footnotemw40"><sup>40</sup></a>
The more one studies Wace, the more evident it becomes that the 'Roman' requires to be
used with the greatest caution. Based on a <i>congeries</i> of authorities,
on tradition, and occasionally of course, on the poetic invention of
the <i>trouveur</i> it presents a whole in which it is almost impossible to
disentangle the various sources of the narrative. Before dealing with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>[pg 314]</span>
the passage which led me to believe that the 'Gesta Regum' must
have been known to Wace, I will glance at some other coincidences.
We have first the alleged landing of William at Hastings instead of
Pevensey. On this Mr Freeman observed:</p>

<blockquote><p>
<i>Venit ad Pevenes&aelig;</i>, says the Tapestry. So William of Poitiers and William
of Jumi&egrave;ges. William of Malmesbury says carelessly, <i>Placido cursu Hastingas
appulerunt</i>. So Wace, who altogether reverses the geography, making the
army land at Hastings and go to Pevensey afterwards.<a id="footnotetagmw41" name="footnotetagmw41"></a><a href="#footnotemw41"><sup>41</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Here William of Malmesbury, who was probably using 'Hastingas'
as loosely as when he applied that term to Battle, appears to be
responsible for the mistake of Wace, who may have tried to harmonize
him with William of Jumi&egrave;ges by making the Normans proceed
to Pevensey after having landed. Take again the hotly disputed
burial of Harold at Waltham. On this question Mr Freeman writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>
William of Malmesbury, after saying that the body was given to Gytha,
adds <i>acceptum itaque apud Waltham sepelivit</i>.... Wace had evidently heard two
or three stories, and, with his usual discretion, he avoided committing himself,
but he distinctly asserts a burial at Waltham.<a id="footnotetagmw42" name="footnotetagmw42"></a><a href="#footnotemw42"><sup>42</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>This, then, is another coincidence between the two writers, while, as
before, Wace found himself in the presence of a conflict of authorities.
On yet another difficult point, the accession of Harold, I see a marked
agreement, though Mr Freeman did not. Harold, according to
William of Malmesbury, <i>extorta a principibus fide, arripuit diadema</i>, and
<i>diademate fastigiatus, nihil de pactis inter se et Willelmum cogitabat</i>.
Wace's version runs:</p>

<div class="poem width15">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Heraut ki ert manant &egrave; forz</p>
<p>Se fist &eacute;noindre &egrave; coroner;</p>
<p>Unkes al duc n'en volt parler,</p>
<p>Homages prist &egrave; f&eacute;eltez</p>
<p>Des plus riches &egrave; des ainz nes.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Not only is the attitude of Wace and William towards Harold's
action here virtually identical, but the mention of his exaction of
homage seems special to them both.</p>

<p>The passages, however, on which I would specially rest my case
are those in which these two writers describe the visit of Harold's
spies to the Norman camp before the battle of Hastings. This
legend is peculiar to William of Malmesbury and Wace, and though
it may be suggested that they had heard it independently, the correspondence&mdash;it
will, I think, be admitted&mdash;is too close to admit of
that solution.</p>

<p>The story is just one of those that William of Malmesbury would
have picked up, and Wace has simply, in metrical paraphrase,
transferred it from his pages to his own.</p>

<p>Yet another story, on which Mr Freeman looked with some just
suspicion, is common to these two writers, and virtually to them
alone. It is that of 'the contrast between the way in which the night
before the battle was spent by the Normans and the English' (iii.
760). Wace, says Mr Freeman, 'gives us the same account' as William
'in more detail', while William 'gives us a shorter account'. I here
again append the passages side by side, insisting on the fact mentioned
by Mr Freeman, that Wace expands the story 'in more
detail':</p>

English, with which I shall deal below; (3) the dismounting of
Harold at the foot of the standard. I here subjoin the parallels for

<p>Mr Freeman, of course, observed the parallel, but, oddly enough,
missed the point. He first quoted the lines from Wace, and then
immediately added, 'So William of Malmesbury' (iii. 764), thus
reversing the natural order. The word that really gave me the clue
was the <i>escuz</i> of Wace. It was obvious, I held, that, here as elsewhere,<a id="footnotetagmw43" name="footnotetagmw43"></a><a href="#footnotemw43"><sup>43</sup></a>
it must mean 'shield'; and Mr Freeman consequently saw
in the passage an undoubted description of the 'shield-wall' (iii.
763). Moreover, the phrase <i>lever escuz</i> is, in Wace, a familiar one,
describing preparation for action, thus, for instance:</p>

<div class="poem width18">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Mult ueissiez Engleis fremir</p>
<p class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;</p>
<p>Armes saisir, escuz leuer.</p>
<p class="i16">(ll. 8030, 8033)</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>On the other hand, there are, in spite of Mr Freeman, undoubted
difficulties in rendering the passage as a description of the 'shield-wall',
just as there are in taking <i>escuz</i> to mean 'barricades' (iii.
471). The result was that, perhaps unconsciously, Mr Freeman
gave the passage, in succession, two contradictory renderings (iii.
471, 763). Now, starting from the fact that the disputed passage
supported, and also opposed both renderings, I arrived at the conclusion
that it must represent some confusion of Wace's own.
He had, evidently, himself no clear idea of what he was describing.
But the whole confusion is at once accounted for if we admit him to
have here also followed William of Malmesbury. His <i>escuz</i>&mdash;otherwise
impossible to explain&mdash;faithfully renders the <i>scuta</i> of
William, while the latter's <i>testudo</i>, though strictly accurate, clearly
led him astray. The fact is that William of Malmesbury must have
been quite familiar with the 'shield-wall', if indeed he had seen the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page318" id="page318"></a>[pg 318]</span>
fyrd actually forming it.<a id="footnotetagmw44" name="footnotetagmw44"></a><a href="#footnotemw44"><sup>44</sup></a> Wace, on the contrary, living later, and
in Normandy instead of England, cannot have seen, or even understood,
this famous formation, with which his cavalry fight of the
twelfth century had nothing in common. It is natural therefore that
his version should betray some confusion, though his <i>Fait en orent
deuant closture</i> clearly renders William of Malmesbury's <i>conserta
ante se scutorum testudine</i>. There is no question as to William's meaning,
for a <i>testudo</i> of shields is excellent Latin for the shield-wall formed by
the Romans against a flight of arrows. Moreover, the construction of
William's Latin (<i>conserta</i>) accounts for that use by Wace of the
pluperfect tense on which stress has been laid as proof that the
passage must describe a 'barricade'.<a id="footnotetagmw45" name="footnotetagmw45"></a><a href="#footnotemw45"><sup>45</sup></a>
That Wace could, occasionally,
be led astray by misunderstanding his authority, is shown by his
taking Harold to Abbeville, after his capture on the French coast, a
statement which arose, in Mr Freeman's opinion, 'from a misconception
of the words of William of Jumi&egrave;ges (iii. 224)'. No one, I
think, can read dispassionately the extracts I have printed side by
side, without accepting the explanation I offer of this disputed
passage in Wace, namely, that it is nothing but a metrical, elaborate,
and somewhat confused paraphrase of the words of William of
Malmesbury.</p>

<p>Passing from William of Malmesbury to the Bayeux Tapestry, we
find a general recognition of the difficulty of determining Wace's
knowledge of it. I can only, like others, leave the point undecided.
On the other hand, his narrative, as a whole, does not follow the
Tapestry; on the other, it is hard to believe that the writer of ll.
8103-38 had not seen that famous work. His description of the
scene is marvellously exact, and the Tapestry phrase, in which Odo
<i>confortat pueros</i>&mdash;often a subject of discussion&mdash;is at once explained
by his making the <i>pueri</i> whom Odo 'comforted' to be&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem width15">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Vaslez, qui al herneis esteient</p>
<p>E le herneis garder deueient.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Of these varlets in charge of the 'harness' he had already spoken
(ll. 7963-7). The difficulty of accounting for Wace, as a canon of
Bayeux, being unacquainted with the Tapestry is, of course, obvious.
But in any case he cannot have used it, as we do ourselves, among
his foremost authorities.</p>

<p>In discussing his use of William of Jumi&egrave;ges, we stand on much
surer ground. It certainly strikes one as strange that in mentioning
the obvious error by which Wace makes Harold receive his wound
in the eye early in the fight (l. 8185), before the great feigned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page319" id="page319"></a>[pg 319]</span>
flight, Mr Freeman does not suggest its derivation from William of
Jumi&egrave;ges, though he proceeds to add (p. 771):</p>

<blockquote><p>
I need hardly stop to refute the strange mistake of William of Jumi&egrave;ges,
followed by Orderic: 'Heraldus ipse in primo militum progressu ['Congressu',
<i>Ord.</i>] vulneribus letaliter confossus occubuit'.
</p></blockquote>

<p>But a worse instance of the contradictions involved by the
patchwork and secondary character of Wace's narrative is found in
his statement as to Harold's arrival on the field of battle. 'Wace,'
says Mr Freeman, 'makes the English reach Senlac on Thursday
night' (p. 441). So he does, even adding that Harold</p>

<div class="poem width15">  <div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">fist son estandart drecier</p>
<p>Et fist son gonfanon fichier</p>
<p>Iloc tot dreit ou l'abeie</p>
<p>De la Bataille est establie.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i16">(ll. 6985-8)</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>But Mr Freeman must have overlooked the very significant fact
that when the battle is about to begin, Wace tells a different story,
and makes Harold only occupy the battlefield on the Saturday
morning:</p>

<div class="poem width18">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Heraut sout que Normant vendreient</p>
<p>E que par main se combatreient:</p>
<p>Un champ out <i>par matin</i> porpris,</p>
<p>Ou il a toz ses Engleis mis.</p>
<p><i>Par matin</i> les fist toz armer</p>
<p>E a bataille conreer.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i16">(ll. 7768-72)</p>
</div>  </div>

<p>I have little doubt that he here follows William of Jumi&egrave;ges:
'[Heraldus] in campo belli apparuit mane', and that he was thus
led to contradict himself.</p>

<p>Mr Freeman had a weakness for Wace, and did not conceal it:
he insisted on the poet's 'honesty'. But 'honesty' is not knowledge;
and in dealing with the battle, it is not allowable to slur over Wace's
imperfect knowledge. Mr Freeman admits that 'probably he did
not know the ground, and did not take in the distance between
Hastings and Battle' (p. 762). But he charitably suggests that 'it is
possible that when he says "en un tertre s'estut li dus" he meant the
hill of Telham, only without any notion of its distance from Hastings'.
But, in spite of this attempt to smooth over the discrepancy, it is
impossible to reconcile Wace's narrative with that of Mr Freeman.
The latter makes the duke deliver his speech at Hastings, and then
march with his knights to Telham, and there arm. But Wace
imagined that they armed in their quarters at Hastings ('Issi
sunt as tentes ale'), and straightway fought. The events immediately
preceding the battle are far more doubtful and difficult to determine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page320" id="page320"></a>[pg 320]</span>
than could be imagined from Mr Freeman's narrative, but I must
confine myself to Wace's version. I have shown that his account is
not consistent as to the movements of Harold, while as to the topography,
'his primary blunder', as Mr Freeman terms it, 'of reversing
the geographical order, by making William land at Hastings and
thence go to Pevensey', together with his obvious ignorance of the
character and position of the battlefield, must, of course, lower our
opinion of his accuracy, and of the value of the oral tradition at his
disposal.</p>

<p>To rely 'mainly'<a id="footnotetagmw46" name="footnotetagmw46"></a><a href="#footnotemw46"><sup>46</sup></a>
on such a writer, in preference to the original
authorities he confused, or to follow him when, in Mr Freeman's
words, he actually 'departs from contemporary authority, and merely
sets down floating traditions nearly a hundred years after the latest
events which he records'&mdash;betrays the absence of a critical faculty,
or the consciousness of a hopeless cause.</p>

The word 'fenestres', for instance, which Mr Archer first rendered 'ash', out
of deference to Mr Freeman and his predecessors, but subsequently 'windows'
(<cite>English Historical Review</cite>, ix. 18), is either a corruption or quite inexplicable. 'If it
pleases Mr Archer,' as I wrote (<cite>Ibid.</cite>, 236), 'to construct a barricade, of which
"windows" are the chief ingredient, on an uninhabited Sussex down, in 1066, he
is perfectly welcome to do so.' I may add that the rendering adopted by the two
French scholars does not in the least alter my view as to the improbability, or
rather absurdity, of the suggestion.</p>

The case of the battle of Varaville, in 1058, is precisely similar in this respect
to that of the Battle of Hastings. Of the former Mr Freeman writes: 'Wace alone
speaks, throughout his narrative, of a bridge. All the other writers speak only of a
ford' (iii. 173). Now Wace's authority was better for this, the earlier battle, because,
says Mr Freeman, he knew the ground. Yet the Professor did not hesitate to reject
his 'bridge'. So again, in 'the campaign of Hastings', Mr Freeman rejects 'the
falsehood of the story of William burning his ships, of which the first traces appear
in Wace' (iii. 408). So much for placing our reliance upon Wace, when he stands
alone.</p>

We have, I suspect, a similar instance, in Wace's <i>gisarmes</i> (ll. 7794, 7814,
8328, 8332, 8342, 8587, 8629, 8656). An excellent vindication of the Bayeux
Tapestry&mdash;oddly enough overlooked by Mr Freeman&mdash;namely, M. Delauney's
'Origine de la Tapisserie de Bayeux prouv&eacute;e par elle-m&ecirc;me' (Caen, 1824)&mdash;discusses
the weapons, the author observing: 'La hache d'armes ressemble &agrave;

(see Jubinal, <cite>La Tapisserie de Bayeux</cite>, p. 17). This exactly describes the true <i>gisarme</i>,
a later introduction. So again, Wace makes the <i>chevalier</i> who has hurried from
Hastings exclaim to Harold:

<h3>NOTE ON THE PSEUDO-INGULF</h3><!-- pi -->

<p>I owe to my friend Mr Hubert Hall the suggestion that the great
battle described by the Pseudo-Ingulf as taking place between the
English and the Danes in 870&mdash;and all accepted as sober fact by
Turner in his <cite>History of the Anglo-Saxons</cite>&mdash;may be a concoction
based on the facts of the battle of Hastings. This is also the theory
Mr Freeman advanced as to Snorro's story of the battle of Stamford Bridge.
The coincidence is very striking. In both narratives the
defending force is formed with 'the dense shield-wall';<a id="footnotetagpi1" name="footnotetagpi1"></a><a href="#footnotepi1"><sup>1</sup></a>
in both it breaks at length that formation; in both it is, consequently, overwhelmed;
and in both cases the attacking force consists of horsemen
and archers. But the most curious coincidence is found in the
principal weapon of the defending force. In Snorro's narrative, as Mr
Freeman renders it, 'a dense wood of spears bristles in front of
the circle to receive the charge of the English horsemen';<a id="footnotetagpi2" name="footnotetagpi2"></a><a href="#footnotepi2"><sup>2</sup></a>
in the Pseudo-Ingulf the defending force 'contra violentiam equitum densissimam
aciem lancearum pr&aelig;tendebant'.<a id="footnotetagpi3" name="footnotetagpi3"></a><a href="#footnotepi3"><sup>3</sup></a>
Such a defence savours of the days when the knight, fighting on foot with his lance,<a id="footnotetagpi4" name="footnotetagpi4"></a><a href="#footnotepi4"><sup>4</sup></a>
had replaced the housecarl with his battle-axe: it was not that of
Harold's host, but one which we meet with in the twelfth century.</p>

<p>There are marks, however, in the Pseudo-Ingulf, of study, not
merely of the Battle of Hastings, but of William of Malmesbury's
account of it. From him, it would seem, are taken the words 'testudo'
and 'tumulus'. The first parallel passages are these:</p>

<h3>REGENBALD, PRIEST AND CHANCELLOR</h3><!-- reg -->

<p>No better illustration could be given of the fact that valuable
historical evidence may lurk, even in print, unknown, than the
charters printed, from the Cirencester Cartulary, by Sir Thomas
Phillips in <cite>Arch&aelig;ologia</cite> (1836).<a id="footnotetagreg1" name="footnotetagreg1"></a><a href="#footnotereg1"><sup>1</sup></a>
One can imagine how highly prized
they would have been by Mr Freeman, had he only known of their
existence.</p>

<p>Regenbald, of whom Sir Thomas would seem never to have heard,
was the first Chancellor of England.<a id="footnotetagreg2" name="footnotetagreg2"></a><a href="#footnotereg2"><sup>2</sup></a>
Mr Freeman called him, I know not on what authority, 'the Norman chancellor of Eadward'.
Whatever his nationality, it is well established that he was that king's
chancellor. He occurs repeatedly in Domesday, where he is distinguished
as 'Canceler', 'Presbyter', and 'de Cirencestre'. We learn
also from its pages that he held land in at least three counties&mdash;Berkshire,
Herefordshire, and Dorset T.R.E.&mdash;and that he seems to
have received further grants from King William in his return.<a id="footnotetagreg3" name="footnotetagreg3"></a><a href="#footnotereg3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>The three charters of which I treat are found in the Cirencester
Cartulary and are in Anglo-Saxon. The first is one of King Edward's
in favour of 'Reinbold min preost', and is a confirmation to him of
soc and sac, toll and team, etc., as his predecessors had enjoyed it
'on Cnutes kinges daie'. The third is a notification from King William
that 'ic h&aelig;bbe geunnen Regenbald minan preoste eall his lond' as
'he hit under <ins title="Edwearde">Ed&#447;earde</ins> h&aelig;dde mine meie'. The chief points to be
noticed here are that the land is granted <i>de novo</i>, not confirmed, and
that the Conqueror speaks of Regenbald as 'minan preoste', implying
that he has taken him into his service.</p>

<p>It is the second of these charters that is of quite extraordinary
importance. I here append it <i>in extenso</i> as printed by Sir Thomas
Phillips:</p>

<p>'Vyllelm king gret Hereman b. &amp; Wulstan b. &amp; Eustace eorl &amp;

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page324" id="page324"></a>[pg 324]</span></p>

<p>The relevant entry in Domesday speaks for itself:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Reinbaldus presbyter tenet Latone et Aisi. Duo taini tenuerunt pro II.
Maneriis T.R.E. Heraldus comes junxit in unum. Geldabat pro ix. hidis
(68<i>b</i>).
</p></blockquote>

<p>If the charter were nothing more than a grant from the Conqueror
to a private individual of lands duly entered in Domesday, it would, I
believe, as such be unique. Historians have long and vainly sought
for any genuine charter of the kind; and here it has been in print
for nearly sixty years.</p>

<p>But the document, I hope to show, does far more for us than this:
it opens a new chapter in the history of the Norman Conquest.</p>

<p>We first notice that the writ is addressed not to Norman, but to
English authorities. The only exception is Count Eustace, who was,
of course, not a Norman, and who was known in England before the
Conquest as brother-in-law to Edward the Confessor. The obvious
inference is that, at the time this writ was issued, Norman government
had not yet been set up in the district. Urse d'Abetot, for
instance, the dreaded sheriff of Worcestershire, would probably
have been addressed in conjunction with Bishop Wulstan had he
been then in power. But we know that he came into power soon
after the Conquest, for he had time to be guilty of oppression and
to be rebuked for it by Ealdred before that Primate's death in 1069.
But as our writ is of this early date, it must be previous to the treason
of Count Eustace in 1067. It must therefore belong to the beginning
of that year, when William had only recently been crowned
king.</p>

<p>We see then here, I think, the Conqueror, in his first days as an
English king, addressing his subjects, in a part of the realm not
yet under Norman sway, and doing so in their own tongue and in
the forms to which they were accustomed. As King Edward in his
charter to Regenbald had greeted bishops, earls, and sheriffs, so
here his successor greets two bishops, 'Eustace Eorl', and two
Englishmen representing the power of the sheriff. And so again in
his charter to London he began by greeting the Bishop and the
Portreeve.<a id="footnotetagreg4" name="footnotetagreg4"></a><a href="#footnotereg4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>The writ, it will be seen, is addressed to the authorities of
Gloucestershire and Wilts. The estate lay in the latter county, but
the connection of Regenbald de 'Cirencestre' with Glo'stershire
may account for the inclusion of that county. Can we identify
'Eadrich' and 'Bristrich' with any local magnates? With some
confidence I boldly suggest that the latter was no other than the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page325" id="page325"></a>[pg 325]</span>
'Bristricus' of the Exon Domesday, that famous Brihtric, the son of
&AElig;lfgar, who, to quote from the appendix Mr Freeman devotes to
him, 'appears distinctly as a great landowner in most of the western
shires', one from whose vast domains was carved out later the great
Honour of Gloucester. Until now, all we have known of him has been
derived from the Domesday entries of his estates T.R.E. and from
the legend which associates his name with that of Queen Matilda.
But this charter enables us to say that he was living and still holding
his great position in the west in the early days of William's reign.<a id="footnotetagreg5" name="footnotetagreg5"></a><a href="#footnotereg5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>From 'Bristric' I turn to 'Eadric', and ask if we may not here
recognize 'Eadric the Wild' himself? This can only be matter of
conjecture, but it is certain that these two Englishmen are here
assigned the place that would be given to a sheriff, and that 'Eadric
the Wild'&mdash;'quidam pr&aelig;potens minister', as Florence terms him&mdash;was
a magnate in the west (Herefordshire and Shropshire) at the
time of the Conquest. Mr Freeman terms him 'a man about whom
we should gladly know more'. It is stated by Orderic that he was one
of those who came in and submitted to William at the outset. But
Mr Freeman held it 'far more likely that he did not submit till a
much later time', because Florence says of him in William's absence:
'se dedere Regi dedignabatur'. Orderic's statement, however, is not
denied, and Florence's words seem to me quite explicable by the
hypothesis that Eadric had refused the 'dangerous honour', as Mr
Freeman terms it, of following William to Normandy in 1067 among
'his English attendants or hostages'. Harried, in consequence, by his
Norman neighbours, he retaliated by ravaging Herefordshire in
August of that year; while Count Eustace also threw off his allegiance
and made his descent on Dover.</p>

<p>If the identity of 'Eadric' is matter of conjecture, that of 'Eustace
eorl' is certain. But no one has known, or even suspected, that he
held, at this period, high position in the west. It may be that, as I
have already hinted, he was sent by William to a district, as yet only
nominally subject, as being, from his previous connection with
England, less obnoxious than a Norman was likely to prove. It
would be refining overmuch to suggest that William might also
intend to establish him as far as possible from his base of operations at
Boulogne.</p>

<p>In any case, we have in this charter a welcome addition to our
scanty knowledge of that obscure period when William, as it were,
was feeling his feet as an English king. Nor is it its least important
feature that it shows us William, contrary to what Mr Freeman held
to be his fundamental rule, speaking of his predecessor as 'Harald
kinge'.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page326" id="page326"></a>[pg 326]</span></p>

<p>Before taking leave of Regenbald, we may glance at one of the
Domesday entries relating to his lands. Mr Freeman, in two distinct
passages, wrote as follows:</p>

<table class="diff1" summary="comparison" border="0">
<tr>
       <td class="w2">
       An entry in 99 reads as if the
       same Regenbald had been defrauded
       of land by a Norman tenant of his
       own. 'Ricardus tenet in Rode i.
       hidam, quam ipse tenuit de
       Rainboldo presbytero licentia
       regis, ut dicit. Reinbold vero
       tenuit T.R.E.'<br />
       (<cite>Norm. Conq.</cite>, v. 751)
       </td>
       <td class="w2">
		The rights of the antecessor are
		handed on to the grantee of his
		land. ... So in Exon 432.
		'Ricardus interpres habet
		i. hidam terr&aelig; in Roda quam ipse
		emit de Rainboldo sacerdote
	    [Eadward's chancellor?] per
	    licentiam regis, ut dicit qui
	    tenuit eam die qua Rex E.
	    fuit<a id="footnotetagreg6" name="footnotetagreg6"></a><a href="#footnotereg6"><sup>6</sup></a>
		et mortuus.'<br />
	    (<cite>Ibid.</cite>, p. 784)
	    </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Although these two passages are found in two different appendices,
the entries thus diversely adduced, are, of course, one and the same.
But, it will be seen, the 'tenuit' of Domesday is equated by the 'emit'
of the Exon book. One of the two must be wrong. I should accept the
Exon text because 'emit licentia regis' is the right Domesday phrase,
because it makes better sense, and because it is a sound principle of
textual criticism that the Exchequer scribe was more likely to write
the usual 'tenuit' for the exceptional 'emit' than the Exon scribe to
do the converse. I should then read the passage thus: 'emit de
Rainboldo sacerdote&mdash;per licentiam regis, ut dicit&mdash;qui tenuit
eam die', etc.</p>

<p>If my view be adopted, we here detect noteworthy error in our
great and sacrosanct record.</p>

<p>The charter of Henry I to Cirencester Abbey&mdash;in which he had
placed Canons Regular, and of which he claimed to be the founder&mdash;sets,
as it were, the coping-stone on the story of Regenbald.<a id="footnotetagreg7" name="footnotetagreg7"></a><a href="#footnotereg7"><sup>7</sup></a>
In it we read:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Dedi et concessi ... totam tenuram Reimbaldi presbyteri in terris et
ecclesiis, et ceteris omnibusqu&aelig; subscripta sunt....</p>

<p>De rebus autem predictis qu&aelig; fuerunt Rembaldi hec statuimus.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The details of Regenbald's possessions are given, and are of special
value for collation with Domesday. They set him before us not only
as a landowner in five different counties, but also as the first great
pluralist. Sixteen churches, rich in tithes and glebe&mdash;one might
really term them 'fat livings'&mdash;had passed into the hands of Regenbald
'the priest'. From the king's phrase, '<i>dedi</i> et concessi', he would
seem to have been not merely confirming an endowment by
Regenbald, but granting lands which had escheated to himself.<a id="footnotetagreg8" name="footnotetagreg8"></a><a href="#footnotereg8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page327" id="page327"></a>[pg 327]</span></p>

<p>And this conclusion is confirmed by the fact that the king, while
granting them, especially reserved the life interest of the Bishop of
Salisbury and of two others&mdash;one of them, alas! a bishop's nephew&mdash;who
must have acquired their rights since Regenbald's death.</p>

<p>This charter, apart from its contents, is of great interest from its
mention of the place where and the time when it was granted,
together with its list of witnesses. These were the two Archbishops,
the Bishops of Salisbury, Winchester, Lincoln, Durham, Ely,
Hereford, and Rochester: Robert 'de Sigillo', Robert de Ver,
Miles of Gloucester, Robert d'Oilli, Hugh Bigot, Robert de Curci,
Payne 'filius Johannis et Eustacio et Willelmo fratribus ejus, et
Willelmo de Albini Britone'. The charter was granted 'apud Burnam
in transfretatione mea anno incarnationis Domini MCXXXIII.
regni vero mei XXXIII.'; and 'Burna', as I have elsewhere shown,<a id="footnotetagreg9" name="footnotetagreg9"></a><a href="#footnotereg9"><sup>9</sup></a>
was Westbourne in Sussex, on the border of Hampshire, then in the
king's hands by forfeiture and near the coast. Here therefore we see
the king, when leaving England for the last time, surrounded by his
prelates and ministers, and are enabled to say positively who were
with him. I would note the predominance of the official class
represented by the Bishops of Salisbury, Lincoln, and Ely, by the
late chancellor, the Bishop of Durham, and by laymen who are
found specially entrusted with administrative work. A long list of
witnesses such as this is specially characteristic of the closing period
of the reign,<a id="footnotetagreg10" name="footnotetagreg10"></a><a href="#footnotereg10"><sup>10</sup></a>
and, of course, always possesses biographical value.<a id="footnotetagreg11" name="footnotetagreg11"></a><a href="#footnotereg11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p>Another English writ of the Conqueror, which may be profitably
compared with that we have discussed, is found in one of the
cartularies of Bury St Edmund's.<a id="footnotetagreg12" name="footnotetagreg12"></a><a href="#footnotereg12"><sup>12</sup></a>
Its address, as rendered in the
transcript, runs:</p>

<blockquote><p>
William [<i>sic</i>] kyng gret &AElig;gelm&aelig;r Bischop and Raulf Eorl and Nordman
and ealle myne thegnaes on Sudfolke frendliche.
</p></blockquote>

<p>This writ is obviously previous to the deposition of Bishop &AElig;thelm&aelig;r
in April, 1070, but how far previous it is not easy to say. 'Nordman'
is clearly the sheriff of Suffolk, who appears in Domesday as
'Normannus Vicecomes' (II. 438). His name affords presumption,
though not proof, that he was of English birth;<a id="footnotetagreg13" name="footnotetagreg13"></a><a href="#footnotereg13"><sup>13</sup></a>
and as his Domesday
holding consisted only of rights over two Ipswich burgesses
(which he may have acquired during his shrievalty) he is hardly
likely to have been one of the conquering race. Of the third official,
Earl Ralf, we know a good deal. Mr Freeman was much puzzled by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page328" id="page328"></a>[pg 328]</span>
this 'somewhat mysterious person',<a id="footnotetagreg14" name="footnotetagreg14"></a><a href="#footnotereg14"><sup>14</sup></a>
but eventually came to the
conclusion that 'there were two Ralfs in Norfolk, father and son, the
younger being the son of a Breton mother: the elder was staller under
Edward and Earl under William'. The younger was the Earl of
Norfolk (or 'of the East Angles'), who rebelled and was forfeited in
1075; the elder was that 'Rawulf' who, in the words of the chronicle,
'w&aelig;s Englisc and w&aelig;s geboren on Nor&#240;folce'. Putting our evidence
together, I lean strongly to the view that we have here, as in the case
of Regenbald, a writ addressed to English authorities before Norfolk
had passed into the hands of Norman authorities. Mr Freeman held
that a passage in Domesday (II. 194), to which he had given much
attention, should be read&mdash;'Hanc terram habuit A[rfastus] episcopus
in tempore utrorumque [Radulforum]', and that therefore 'the
elder Ralph was living as late as 1070, in which year the episcopate
of Erfast begins'. But the context clearly shows that we should read
'A[ilmarus] episcopus', and that, therefore, the elder Ralf died before
&AElig;thelm&aelig;r was deposed. Moreover, Norwich, we are specially
told, was entrusted by the Conqueror to William fitz Osbern before
his departure from England in March 1067. William was placed,
some two years later, in charge of York castle, and we read in Mr
Freeman's work that 'the man who now (autumn, 1069) commanded
at Norwich, and who was already, or soon afterwards, invested with
the East-Anglian Earldom, was the renegade native of the shire,
Ralf of Wader'.<a id="footnotetagreg15" name="footnotetagreg15"></a><a href="#footnotereg15"><sup>15</sup></a> This, it will be seen, contradicts his own, and
supports my reading of the Domesday passage quoted above. Everything
therefore points to the 'Raulf Eorl' of our writ dying or being
deposed shortly after the Conquest.</p>

<p>Before taking leave of this writ we may note that, dealing as it
does with Suffolk, it is addressed to Earl Ralf as Earl, not merely of
Norfolk, but of East Anglia. This is of some importance, because Mr
Freeman wrote, speaking of the Regents appointed in 1067:</p>

<blockquote><p>
There was no longer to be an Earl of the West Saxons or an Earl of the
East Angles.... Returning in this to earlier English practice, the Earl under
William was to have the rule of a single shire only, or if two shires were ever
set under one Earl they were at least not to be adjoining shires. The results
of this change have been of the highest moment. (iv. 70.)
</p></blockquote>

<p>Yet on page 253, as we have seen, we read of 'the East Anglian Earldom',
and on page 573 that the younger Ralph 'had received the
Earldom of East Anglia'&mdash;Florence of Worcester distinctly terming
him 'East-Anglorum comite'. Mr Freeman, indeed, was led by this
passage to style him 'Earl of Norfolk or of the East Angles'.<a id="footnotetagreg16" name="footnotetagreg16"></a><a href="#footnotereg16"><sup>16</sup></a> I believe
this latter style to be perfectly correct, and, as I have shown in my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page329" id="page329"></a>[pg 329]</span>
<cite>Geoffrey de Mandeville</cite> (p. 191), to apply even to the Bigod earldom in
the days of Stephen.</p>

<p>The curious English writ that has suggested these considerations
ought to be compared with a Latin one, also in favour of St Edmund's,
on which I lighted in examining the 'Registrum Album' of
the Abbey. It is one of those exceedingly rare documents that find
their correlatives in Domesday. The words of the writ are these:</p>

<blockquote><p>
W. rex Anglor' E. epo. B. Abbi W. Malet salm. sciatis vos mei fideles me
concessisse servitium de Liuremere quam Werno hactenus de me tenuit
sancto &AElig;dmundo Et filia Guernonis in vita sua de Abbate B. tenuit.<a id="footnotetagreg17" name="footnotetagreg17"></a><a href="#footnotereg17"><sup>17</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>The last clause is clearly an addition by the cartulary scribe. Now
this charter being addressed, like the other, to &AElig;thelm&aelig;r ('Ethelmerus'),
Bishop of the East Angles, is, of course, previous to April
1070. I should, therefore, also place it previous to the capture of
William Malet at York in September 1069. But this, unlike the
other date, is matter of probability rather than of proof. Mr Freeman
believed that William returned, and died 'in the marshes of Ely'
(1071), but this is only a guess in which I cannot concur.<a id="footnotetagreg18" name="footnotetagreg18"></a><a href="#footnotereg18"><sup>18</sup></a> In any
case, we have evidence here of this well-known man having held a
position in Suffolk (where he owned the great Honour of Eye)
analogous to that of sheriff. He may have succeeded Northman in
that office.</p>

<p>The relevant Domesday entry is as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Hujus terram rex accepit de abbate et dedit Guernoni depeiz [de Peiz].
Postea licencia regis deveniens monachus reddidit terram. (363<i>b</i>.)
</p></blockquote>

<p>The charter records, I take it, the 'licencia regis' of Domesday.<a id="footnotetagreg19" name="footnotetagreg19"></a><a href="#footnotereg19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p class="footnote1"><a id="footnotereg1" name="footnotereg1"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotetagreg1"><sup>1</sup></a>

<p class="footnote"><a id="footnotereg2" name="footnotereg2"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotetagreg2"><sup>2</sup></a>

<p class="footnote"><a id="footnotereg4" name="footnotereg4"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotetagreg4"><sup>4</sup></a>
It might even be suggested that not only this charter but the Essex writ in
favour of Deorman (addressed to Bishop William and Swegen the sheriff) belonged
to the same early period. Compare, however, the Conqueror's Old English writ
that I have discussed ('Londoners and the Chase') in the <cite>Athen&aelig;um</cite> of June 30, 1894.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="footnotereg5" name="footnotereg5"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotetagreg5"><sup>5</sup></a>
It is a noteworthy coincidence that 'Brihtricus princeps' and 'Eadricus princeps'
are among the witnesses to Harold's Waltham charter in 1062, which Regenbald
himself also attests as Chancellor.</p>

Since this paper was written, there has appeared the valuable Bath Cartulary
(Somerset Record Society) containing a most remarkable charter (p. 36), which
should be closely compared with those to Regenbald. It is issued by William the
King and William the Earl, and must undoubtedly be assigned to the former's
absence from England, March-December 1067. It shows us therefore William
fitz Osbern acting as Regent and anticipating the office of the later Great Justiciar
by inserting in the document his own name. This charter, like that to Regenbald,
is addressed to the still English authorities of an unconquered district.

<h3>THE CONQUEROR AT EXETER</h3><!-- ce -->

<p class="title1c">'And y seide nay, and proved hit by Domesday.'<a id="footnotetagce1" name="footnotetagce1"></a><a href="#footnotece1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>For a companion study to the Battle of Hastings, one could not
select a better subject than the Siege of Exeter by William in 1068.
It is so, because, in the tale of the Conquest, 'No city of England',
in Mr Freeman's words, 'comes so distinctly to the front as Exeter':<a id="footnotetagce2" name="footnotetagce2"></a><a href="#footnotece2"><sup>2</sup></a>
and because, as editor of 'Historic Towns', he chose Exeter, out of
all others, as the town to be reserved for himself.<a id="footnotetagce3" name="footnotetagce3"></a><a href="#footnotece3"><sup>3</sup></a>
'Its siege by William', we are told, 'is one of the most important events of his
reign';<a id="footnotetagce4" name="footnotetagce4"></a><a href="#footnotece4"><sup>4</sup></a>
but it was doubtless the alleged 'federal' character of
Exeter's attitude at this crisis that gave its story for him an interest
so unique. This episode, moreover, has many advantages: it is complete
in itself; it is rich in suggestion; it is taken from the period in
which the Professor described himself as 'most at home'; and its
scene is laid within his own borders, his own West Saxon land. It
presents an admirable test of Mr Freeman's work at the point
where he was admittedly strongest, and his thoroughly typical treatment
of it affords a perfect illustration of the method he employed.</p>

<p>The year 1067 was drawing to its close when the Conqueror, summoned
back from Normandy by the tidings of pressing danger,
returned to spend his Christmas at Westminster amidst 'the sea of
troubles which still awaited him in his half-conquered island-kingdom'.<a id="footnotetagce5" name="footnotetagce5"></a><a href="#footnotece5"><sup>5</sup></a>
Threatened at once by foes within and without the
realm, he perceived the vital necessity of severing their forces by
instant suppression of the 'rebellions' at home, <em>swift</em> suppression
before the invaders were upon him, <em>stern</em> suppression before the
movement spread. Let us bear in mind these twin motives, by
which his policy must at this juncture have been shaped, the
need for <em>swiftness</em>, with invasion in prospect, and the need for <i>sternness</i>
as a warning to 'rebels'.</p>

<p>Of all the 'rebellious' movements on foot, that at Exeter, as Mr
Freeman admits, was 'specially hateful in William's eyes'.<a id="footnotetagce6" name="footnotetagce6"></a><a href="#footnotece6"><sup>6</sup></a>
It was against Exeter, therefore, that the Conqueror directed his first blow.
In the depths of winter, in the early days of the new year, 'he fared
to Devonshire'. Such is the brief statement of the English Chronicle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page331" id="page331"></a>[pg 331]</span></p>

<p>We hear of William at Westminster; we next hear of him before the
walls of Exeter: all that intervenes is a sheer blank. Of what happened
on this long westward march not a single detail is preserved
to us in the Chronicle, in Orderic or in Florence. Now it is precisely
such a blank as this that, to Mr Freeman, was irresistible. We shall
see below how, a few months later, we have, in William's march from
Warwick to Nottingham, a blank exactly parallel.<a id="footnotetagce7" name="footnotetagce7"></a><a href="#footnotece7"><sup>7</sup></a>
There also Mr Freeman succumbed to the temptation. He seized, in each case, on
the empty canvas, and, by a few rapid and suggestive touches, he
has boldly filled it in with the outlines of historical events, not
merely events for which there is no sufficient evidence, but events
which can be proved, by demonstration, to have had no foundation
in fact.</p>

<p>The scene elaborated by Mr Freeman to enliven the void between
the departure from London and the entrance into Devonshire is
<span class="scb">the resistance and the downfall of 'the Civic League'</span>.<a id="footnotetagce8" name="footnotetagce8"></a><a href="#footnotece8"><sup>8</sup></a>
This striking incident in the Exeter campaign I propose to analyse without
further delay.</p>

<p>It must, in the first place, be pointed out that we have no proof
whatever of this 'Civic League' having even existed. To apply Mr
Freeman's words to his own narrative:</p>

<blockquote><p>
The story is perfectly possible. We only ask for the proof. Show us the
proof;... then we will believe. Without such a proof we will not believe.<a id="footnotetagce9" name="footnotetagce9"></a><a href="#footnotece9"><sup>9</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>For proof of its existence Mr Freeman relies on a solitary passage
in Orderic.<a id="footnotetagce10" name="footnotetagce10"></a><a href="#footnotece10"><sup>10</sup></a>
But Orderic, it will at once be seen, does not say that
any such league was effected; he does not even say that the league
which was contemplated was intended to be an exclusively Civic
League. What he does say is that the men of Exeter sought for allies
in the neighbouring coasts (<i>plag&aelig;</i>)<a id="footnotetagce11" name="footnotetagce11"></a><a href="#footnotece11"><sup>11</sup></a>
and in other cities. The Dorset
townlets, such as Bridport, with its 120 houses, would scarcely represent
these 'cities'. Mr Freeman assumed, however, that 'the Civic
League' was formed, assumed that the Dorset towns had 'doubtless'
joined it, and finally assumed that they were 'no doubt' besieged by
William in consequence.<a id="footnotetagce12" name="footnotetagce12"></a><a href="#footnotece12"><sup>12</sup></a>
These assumptions he boldly connected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page332" id="page332"></a>[pg 332]</span>
with the entries on the towns in Domesday, entries which we shall
analyse below, and which are not only incorrectly rendered, but are
directly opposed to the above assumptions.</p>

<p>What, then, is the inference to be drawn? Simply this. The 'Civic
League' must share the fate of the 'palisade on Senlac'. The sieges
which took place 'probably' never took place at all; the League
never resisted; the League never fell; in short, there is not a scrap of
evidence that there was ever such a League at all. The existence of
such a League would be, unquestionably, a fact of great importance.
But its very importance imperatively requires that its existence
should be established by indisputable proof. Of such proof there is
none. One can imagine how severely Mr Freeman would have
handled such guesses from others. For he wrote of a deceased
Somersetshire historian who boldly connects the story of Gisa with
the banishment of Godwine:</p>

<blockquote><p>
One is inclined to ask with Henry II, 'Qu&aelig;re a rustico illo utrum hoc
somniaverit?' But these things have their use. Every instance in the growth of
a legend affords practice in the art of distinguishing legend from history.
</p></blockquote>

<p>It should, however, in justice be at once added that this story did
not originate wholly with Mr Freeman himself. He refers us on the
subject of the League to his predecessor, Sir Francis Palgrave. The
brilliant imagination of that graceful writer was indeed led captive
by the fascinating vision of 'the first Federal Commonwealth', yet he
did not allow himself, when dealing with the facts, to deviate from
the exact truth. His statement that Exeter '<i>attempted to form</i> a defensive
confederation' reproduces with scrupulous accuracy Orderic's
words. And even when he passed from fact to conjecture, there was
nothing in his conjecture at variance from fact. From him we have
no suggestion that the Dorset towns resisted William or 'stood
sieges'. It was left for Mr Freeman to carry into action Palgrave's
line of thought, and, by forcing the evidence of the Domesday
Survey into harmony with the story he had evolved, to show us, in his
own words, 'the growth of a legend'. For, as he observed with perfect
truth:</p>

<blockquote><p>
What we call the growth of a story is really the result of the action of a
number of human wills. The convenient metaphor must not delude us into
thinking that a story really grows of itself as a tree grows. In a crowd of cases
... the story comes of a state of mind which does not willingly sin against
historical truth, but which has not yet learned that there is such a thing as
historical truth.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Had Mr Freeman done so himself? Did he ever really learn to distinguish
conjecture from fact? One asks this because within the covers
of a single work, his <i>English Towns and Districts</i>, that Civic League
which in the <cite>Norman Conquest</cite> is said to have existed 'no doubt', is in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page333" id="page333"></a>[pg 333]</span>
one place said to have existed 'perhaps', and in another is set forth
as an undoubted historic fact:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Exeter stood forth for one moment ... the chief of a confederation of the
lesser towns of the West.... A confederation of the western towns, with the
great city of the district at their head, suddenly started into life to check the
progress of the Conqueror.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Finally, in his 'Exeter' (1887), the same story again appears, without
a word of caution, as absolute historic fact. Exeter, we read, was</p>

<blockquote><p>
the head of a gathering of smaller commonwealths around her; ... the towns
of Dorset were in league with Exeter.... We have no record of the march,
but it is plain that the towns of Dorset were fearfully harried.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Through all Mr Freeman's work we trace this same tendency to
confuse his own conjectures with proved historic fact.</p>

<p>For the details of this fearful harrying we are referred to the
Domesday Survey. It was 'no doubt', we learn, when William
marched on Exeter (1068), that</p>

<blockquote><p>
Dorchester, Bridport, Wareham, and Shaftesbury underwent that fearful
harrying, the result of which is recorded in Domesday. Bridport was utterly
ruined; not a house seems to have been able to pay taxes at the time of the
Survey. At Dorchester, the old Roman settlement, the chief town of the
shire, only a small remnant of the houses escaped destruction. These facts
are signs, etc., etc.
</p></blockquote>

<p>'These facts', we find, will not bear investigation. To refute them in
the case of Bridport, 'there is nothing to be done but to turn to the
proper place in the great Survey'. Following this, his own, precept,
we learn that there is nothing in Domesday of our author's 'utter
ruin'; and that so far from 'not a house' being 'able to pay taxes',
Domesday tells us that four-fifths of the houses then existing could
and did pay them. Here, again, the errors arose from not reading
Domesday 'with common care'. The entry runs: 'Modo sunt ibi c.
domus, et xx. sunt ita destitut&aelig;', etc. The meaning, of course, is that
twenty houses were impoverished. Mr Freeman must have hurriedly
misconstrued his Latin, and read it as a hundred and twenty. No
error that he detected in Mr Froude could be worse than representing
Bridport, on the authority of Domesday, as the greatest
sufferer among the Dorset towns, when Domesday itself proves that
it suffered least of all. And so, too, with Dorchester. On turning to
Domesday, we learn with surprise that the 'small remnant' of
houses remaining there was eighty-eight as against one hundred and
seventy-two in the days of King Edward. From an appendix of our
author's to which we are referred, we glean the fact that</p>

<blockquote><p>
at Dorchester, out of a hundred and seventy-two houses no less than a
hundred and twenty-eight were 'penitus destruct&aelig; a tempore Hugonis
vicecomitis usque nunc'.
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page334" id="page334"></a>[pg 334]</span></p>

<p>Here, again, Mr Freeman's error can be traced beyond the possibility
of question, to a misreading of Domesday: the entry runs,
'modo sunt ibi quater xx. et viii. [88] domus, et c. [sunt] penitus
destruct&aelig;'. Mr Freeman must have hurriedly ignored the 'quater',
and then added the 'twenty-eight' thus evolved to the hundred
houses that were destroyed. All this Mr Freeman did, and we have in
'that great record, from which there is no appeal', the proof of the
fact. Clearly, in the notable words of M. B&eacute;mont (<cite>Revue Historique</cite>), 'il
est prudent de revoir apr&egrave;s lui les textes qu'il invoque'.<a id="footnotetagce13" name="footnotetagce13"></a><a href="#footnotece13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>The strange thing is that Sir Henry Ellis's work, though 'far
from being up to the present standard of historical scholarship', could
have saved him, here also, from error, as it gives the correct figures
from Domesday.</p>

<p>But passing from 'facts' to theories, we find Mr Freeman holding
that 'no doubt', 'doubtless', 'probably', the destruction recorded in
Domesday was wrought by the Conqueror himself in 1068. Why
should this guesswork be substituted for history, when we have
'always the means', as our author himself wrote, 'of at once turning
to the law and testimony to see whether these things are so'? A
glance at Domesday effectually disposes of Mr Freeman's theory;
for the Survey is here peculiarly explicit: with anxious care, with
painful iteration, it assures us that, in the case of Wareham, the
devastation was wrought 'a tempore Hugonis vicecomitis', and that,
in the case of Shaftesbury and in the case of Dorchester, it was
wrought 'a tempore Hugonis vicecomitis usque nunc'. These categorical
statements are conclusive: they place the whole of the devastation
subsequent to the accession of the Norman sheriff, Hugh FitzGrip.
Mr Eyton, in his work on the Dorset Domesday, held that they
fix it as having occurred between 1070 and 1084; the words, however,
'usque nunc' carry it on down to 1086, and, but that I must
now come to Exeter, I could show the real bearing of these allusions
to Sheriff Hugh.</p>

<p>The breakdown, when tested, of the alleged 'Civic League'
strangely vindicates the sound insight of that sagacious historian who
explicitly asserted that the English boroughs</p>

<blockquote><p>
never, as was the case in Scotland and in Germany, adopted a confederate
bond of union, or organized themselves in leagues.<a id="footnotetagce14" name="footnotetagce14"></a><a href="#footnotece14"><sup>14</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Yet, in his <i>English Towns and Districts</i>, Mr Freeman was led by his
own tale of the resistance of the western lands and their capital to
argue from it as from a proved historic fact:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page335" id="page335"></a>[pg 335]</span></p>

<blockquote><p>
When Exeter stood forth for one moment ... <em>the chief of a confederation of
the lesser towns of the West</em> ... we see that the path was opening by which
Exeter might have come to be another L&uuml;beck, the head of a Damnonian
Hanse, another Bern, the mistress of the subject-lands of the western peninsula.
Such a dream sounds wild in our ears.<a id="footnotetagce15" name="footnotetagce15"></a><a href="#footnotece15"><sup>15</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>It does indeed. But it does so for the reason that it is founded on a
fact which has no historic existence. Yet, for Mr Freeman, with his
fertile imagination afire with the glories of ancient Greece and of
countless mediaeval Commonwealths, this same 'wild dream' possessed
an irresistible fascination. 'It is none the less true', he hastened
to add, that</p>

<blockquote><p>
when a confederation of the western towns, with the great city of the district
at their head, suddenly started into life to check the progress of the Conqueror,
it shows that a spirit had been kindled, etc., etc.... It is worth while
to stop and think how near England once was to running the same course as
other lands, etc., etc.<a id="footnotetagce16" name="footnotetagce16"></a><a href="#footnotece16"><sup>16</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Returning now to sober fact, let us ask how the city of Exeter
came into William's hands. This is the pivotal point on which the
whole story revolves. On this point Mr Freeman spoke with no uncertain
sound: the city was 'taken by means of a mine'.<a id="footnotetagce17" name="footnotetagce17"></a><a href="#footnotece17"><sup>17</sup></a>
It was, he wrote, 'by undermining the walls that William at last gained
possession of the city', the citizens being thus forced 'to submit unreservedly'.<a id="footnotetagce18" name="footnotetagce18"></a><a href="#footnotece18"><sup>18</sup></a>
He added, contrasting the success of William with the
failure, in 1003, of Swend:</p>

<blockquote><p>
William might have been beaten back from Exeter as Swend had been,
if the military art of Normandy in William's days had not been many steps
in advance of the military art of Denmark in the days of Swend.
</p></blockquote>

<p>This allusion to 'Swend' involves a perfect tangle of confusion.
Turning back a couple of pages, we are reminded that on Penhow,
'sixty-seven years before (1001), Swend, of Denmark, driven back
from the city, had found his revenge' (p. 154). Guided by a footnote,
we turn for information to the earlier volume to which the author
refers us, only to learn that it was not Swegen, but the adventurer
Pallig who was driven back from Exeter in 1001 (i. 307), while 'of
Swegen himself we hear nothing in English history for nine years
(994-1003)'.<a id="footnotetagce19" name="footnotetagce19"></a><a href="#footnotece19"><sup>19</sup></a>
Moreover, when Swegen did come&mdash;in 1003&mdash;invading
England to avenge the massacre of Saint Brice, he was not 'driven
back from the city', but, on the contrary, 'stormed and plundered it'
(p. 315), for 'the citizens who had beaten back Pallig had no chance
of beating back Swegen' (<cite>Exeter</cite>, p. 27). Moreover, the suggestion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page336" id="page336"></a>[pg 336]</span>
that the Danes would not have been able to attack and breach the
city wall is in direct conflict with the evidence quoted by Mr
Freeman himself. Not only did Pallig, in 1001, direct his attack
against the wall,<a id="footnotetagce20" name="footnotetagce20"></a><a href="#footnotece20"><sup>20</sup></a>
but 'Swegen', we read, in 1003, 'Civitatem Exanceastram
infregit'.<a id="footnotetagce21" name="footnotetagce21"></a><a href="#footnotece21"><sup>21</sup></a>
Now, speaking of 1063, Mr Freeman wrote that
'the expression of Florence "infregit" seems to fall in with' his view
that William breached the wall. That is to say that, according to Mr
Freeman, 'Swend' was 'beaten back' (which he was not), because
he could not breach the walls, which is precisely what, on his
showing, Swegen succeeded in doing. Could confusion further go?</p>

<p>For his statement that 'William's mine advanced so far that part
of the wall crumbled to the ground, making a practicable breach'
(p. 156), Mr Freeman relied on an ingenious combination of
Orderic's statement that the Conqueror 'obnixe satagit cives desuper
impugnare et subtus murum suffodere' with William of Malmesbury's
assertion that he triumphed 'divino scilicet adjutus auxilio,
quod pars muralis ultro decidens ingressum illi patefecerit'. He
argued that, on the supposition that 'Exonia' is the right reading in
William of Malmesbury, his 'story, allowing for a little legendary
improvement, fits so well into Orderic's as to support the theory of a
breach'. The argument is ingenuous and plausible, nor can it be
lightly dismissed. But whether the words of Orderic imply, of necessity,
a mine or not,<a id="footnotetagce22" name="footnotetagce22"></a><a href="#footnotece22"><sup>22</sup></a>
the real point is that he does not mention a
breach. He speaks of William's efforts, but he does not say they were
successful. It is difficult to suppose that William of Poitiers, of whom
Orderic is here the mouthpiece, would not have mentioned his
hero's success, had success rewarded his efforts. We are reduced
then, as the sole and unconfirmed authority for Mr Freeman's absolute
statement&mdash;or rather as the legend from which he 'infers' the
facts he states&mdash;to the words of William of Malmesbury. Now
William was classed, by Mr Freeman himself, among those writers
whose 'accounts are often mixed up with romantic details', so that
'it is dangerous to trust them' (i. 258); and he pointed out of the
murder of Edward that:</p>

<blockquote><p>
In the hands of William of Malmesbury the story becomes a romance....
The <i>obiter dictum</i> of William of Malmesbury that &AElig;lfhere had a hand in
Edward's death is contrary to the whole tenor of the history ... (i. 265).
</p></blockquote>

<p>If there is thus, on Mr Freeman's showing, need for accepting with
some caution a statement made by William alone, there is further, in
this special case, the consideration that even if his story does refer to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page337" id="page337"></a>[pg 337]</span>
Exeter, the phrase, '<i>leviter</i> subegit' is justly queried by Mr Freeman;<a id="footnotetagce23" name="footnotetagce23"></a><a href="#footnotece23"><sup>23</sup></a>
and that William here deals in hyperbole and miracle. Indeed, when
we find Mr Freeman writing: 'I infer this from William of Malmesbury',
we are reminded of his words on his predecessor's treatment
of the legend of Siward: 'Such stuff would not be worth mentioning,
had not Sir Francis Palgrave inferred from it the existence of an
historical Tostig, Earl of Huntingdon' (iv. 768-9). I will not express
an opinion of my own, but will quote from Mr Freeman's able essay
on 'The Mythical and Romantic Elements in Early English History'.<a id="footnotetagce24" name="footnotetagce24"></a><a href="#footnotece24"><sup>24</sup></a>
In it he expressly disclaimed</p>

<blockquote><p>
sympathy with the old pragmatizing or euhemeristic school of mythological
interpretation.... The pragmatizers take a mythical story; they strip it by
an arbitrary process of whatever seems impossible; they explain or allegorize
miraculous details; and having thus obtained something which possibly may
have happened, they give it out as something which actually did happen....
It will never do to take the tale of Troy, to leave out all intervention
of the gods, and to give out the remnant as a piece of real Grecian history
(p. 3).
</p></blockquote>

<p>This criticism would seem to apply to the 'legendary' tale that the
walls of Exeter fell down, like those of Jericho, by supernatural intervention.
At least, we may say of the breaching of the walls, when
given out 'as something which actually did happen', what was said
of the possible siege of Oxford, this same year, by Mr Freeman:</p>

<blockquote><p>
The direct evidence for a siege of Oxford is so weak that the tale cannot
be relied on with any certainty (iv. 188).
</p></blockquote>

<p>Having now examined the direct evidence for the statement that
the citizens were forced to surrender unconditionally to William by
the successful breaching of their walls, I propose to show that the
acceptance of this statement does violence not only to the facts of the
case, but to all that is known of William's character, to the English
Chronicle, and to Domesday; and I shall prove that it rests beyond
dispute 'on the foundation of a single error'.</p>

<p>Assuming for the moment the accuracy of Mr Freeman's version,
namely, that the city had been placed, by a breach, absolutely at
William's mercy, what treatment of its citizens would his character
and his whole career lead us to expect? 'At all stages of his life,' as
Mr Freeman observed, paraphrasing the famous words of the English
Chronicle (1087), 'if he was <i>debonnair</i> to those who would do his will,
he was beyond measure stern to all who withstood it' (ii. 167). Again,
speaking of his march on Exeter, the Professor insisted on the fact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page338" id="page338"></a>[pg 338]</span>
that 'the policy of William was ever severity to those who withstood
him, and gentleness to those who submitted to his yoke'.<a id="footnotetagce25" name="footnotetagce25"></a><a href="#footnotece25"><sup>25</sup></a>
How he applied this principle in practice was shown at Romney and at
Dover in 1066. Romney had successfully resisted the landing of a
party of Normans,<a id="footnotetagce26" name="footnotetagce26"></a><a href="#footnotece26"><sup>26</sup></a>
and William was resolved to avenge the deed.</p>

<blockquote><p>
It was his policy now, as ever, to be harsh whenever he met with resistance,
and gentle to all who submitted easily.... Harrying then as he went,
William reached Romney. The words which set forth his doings there are
short, pithy, and terrible. He took what vengeance he would for the
slaughter of his men (iii. 533-4).
</p></blockquote>

<p>Dover, on the contrary, made no resistance, but surrendered before
he 'had thrown up a bank, or shot an arrow'. It was, therefore,
'plainly his policy to show himself mild and <i>debonnair</i> as it had been
his policy at Romney to show himself beyond measure stark'.<a id="footnotetagce27" name="footnotetagce27"></a><a href="#footnotece27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p>Such being William's settled principle, what might the citizens of
Exeter expect? Even before the siege began the fear that they had
sinned too deeply for forgiveness made them disown the capitulation
their leaders had arranged.<a id="footnotetagce28" name="footnotetagce28"></a><a href="#footnotece28"><sup>28</sup></a>
The reference is doubtless to conduct
similar to that which had brought upon Romney William's merciless
vengeance.<a id="footnotetagce29" name="footnotetagce29"></a><a href="#footnotece29"><sup>29</sup></a>
But how stood the case at its close?</p>

<ul class="none">
<li>(1) They were rebels. And for these 'rebels, as they were deemed
in Norman eyes' (iv. 135), confiscation was the penalty (iv. 127-8).</li>

<li>(2) 'The movement at Exeter' was not merely a rebellion, but one
which was 'specially hateful in William's eyes' (iv. 140).</li>

<li>(3) They had been guilty of 'cruel and insulting treatment' to
William's earlier emissaries (iv. 138).</li>

<li>(4) They had offered William himself an 'insult as unseemly as it
was senseless' (iv. 155).</li>

<li>(5) They had flung to the winds their own capitulation with such
audacity that William 'ira repletus est' (iv. 152).</li>

<li>(6) They had offered a prolonged and desperate resistance, costing
the lives of many of his men (iv. 156).</li>
</ul>

<p>Verily, in William's eyes, the cup of Exeter's iniquities must have
been exceedingly full.</p>

<p>Even in cases of ordinary resistance his practice, we learn, was so
uniform that Mr Freeman could take it for granted, 'after the fall of
Exeter', that</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page339" id="page339"></a>[pg 339]</span></p>

<blockquote><p>
the heavy destruction which fell on the town of Barnstaple, in the north-western
part of Devonshire, and the still heavier destruction which fell on
the town of Lidford, might seem to show that these two boroughs were
special scenes of resistance (iv. 163).<a id="footnotetagce30" name="footnotetagce30"></a><a href="#footnotece30"><sup>30</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Therefore, in the aggravated case of Exeter, we could but expect him
to deal with its citizens as he had dealt with those of Alen&ccedil;on,<a id="footnotetagce31" name="footnotetagce31"></a><a href="#footnotece31"><sup>31</sup></a>
and as he was to deal, hereafter, with the sturdy defenders of Ely.<a id="footnotetagce32" name="footnotetagce32"></a><a href="#footnotece32"><sup>32</sup></a>
A fearful vengeance was their certain doom. There was, moreover, as I
stated at the outset, a need for sternness at this juncture that might
justify William, apart from vengeance, in inflicting such signal
punishment as should deter all other 'rebels'.</p>

<p>Yet what do we find? The citizens, we read, were 'favourably
received', and 'assured of the safe possession of their lives and goods'.
Nay, William even 'secured the gates with a strong guard of men
whom he could trust in order to preserve the goods of the citizens
from any breaches of discipline'.<a id="footnotetagce33" name="footnotetagce33"></a><a href="#footnotece33"><sup>33</sup></a>
The dreaded Conqueror, 'post tot iras terribilesque minas', had suddenly become mild as a lamb, and
Mr Freeman accepts it all quite as a matter of course.</p>

<p>Such conduct would, surely, have been a positive premium on revolt.</p>

<p>A castle, of course, was raised; but this was inevitable, whether a
town submitted peaceably or not. For instance, 'it is plain', Mr
Freeman wrote, 'that Lincolnshire submitted more peaceably, and
was dealt with more tenderly, than most parts of the kingdom' (iv.
216); but 'a castle was, of course, raised at Lincoln, as well as elsewhere',
and 'involved the destruction of a large number of houses'
(217-8), very many more than at Exeter.</p>

<p>One 'penalty', however, remains as the price that Exeter was
called upon to pay for all her guilt. This, we read, was 'the raising
of its tribune to lessen the wealth which had enabled it to resist'.<a id="footnotetagce34" name="footnotetagce34"></a><a href="#footnotece34"><sup>34</sup></a>
For its wealth is admitted. Now, before criticizing Mr Freeman's
view, let us clearly understand what that view was. Taking, as is
right, his latest work&mdash;though his view had not altered&mdash;we read of
Exeter in 1050:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340"></a>[pg 340]</span></p>

<blockquote><p>
The city which had been the morning-gift of Norman Emma was now,
along with Winchester, part of the morning-gift of English Edith, daughter
of Godwine, sister of Harold. At Exeter she was on her own ground; the
royal revenues within the city were hers.<a id="footnotetagce35" name="footnotetagce35"></a><a href="#footnotece35"><sup>35</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>In 1086, we learn:</p>

<blockquote><p>
The whole payment was eighteen pounds yearly. Of this sum six pounds&mdash;that
is the earl's third penny&mdash;went to the Sheriff Baldwin.... The other
twelve pounds had formed part of the morning-gift of the lady, and though
Edith had been dead eleven years, they are entered separately as hers.<a id="footnotetagce36" name="footnotetagce36"></a><a href="#footnotece36"><sup>36</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>So far, all is consistent and clear enough. But we find it immediately
added that:</p>

<blockquote><p>
This regular yearly payment of eighteen pounds had taken the place of
various uncertain payments and services.... Thus the citizens of Exeter,
who had offered to pay to William what they had paid to former kings,
found their burthens far heavier than they had been in the old time. And
the lady, while she lived, reaped her full share of the increased contributions
of her own city.<a id="footnotetagce37" name="footnotetagce37"></a><a href="#footnotece37"><sup>37</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Or, as expressed in his great work:</p>

<blockquote><p>
The money payment was now raised from an occasional half-marc of
silver to eighteen pounds yearly. The rights of the old lady were not forgotten,
and Eadgyth received two-thirds of the increased burthen laid upon
her morning-gift.<a id="footnotetagce38" name="footnotetagce38"></a><a href="#footnotece38"><sup>38</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>If the 'twelve pounds had formed part of the morning-gift of the
lady', and were accordingly received by her, as we learn,<a id="footnotetagce39" name="footnotetagce39"></a><a href="#footnotece39"><sup>39</sup></a>
in the days of King Edward, how could they possibly form part of a new
'burthen' laid upon Exeter, as a punishment for its resistance, by
William? And if the only payment due, under Edward, was an occasional
half-marc of silver 'for the use of the soldiers'<a id="footnotetagce40" name="footnotetagce40"></a><a href="#footnotece40"><sup>40</sup></a>
what were 'the royal revenues' from Exeter that Edith was drawing in 1050? A
moment's thought is enough to show that Mr Freeman's statements
contradict themselves, as, indeed, he must have seen, had he stopped
to think. But this he sometimes failed to do.</p>

<p>The whole source of Mr Freeman's confusion was his inexplicable
misunderstanding of the Domesday entry on the city.<a id="footnotetagce41" name="footnotetagce41"></a><a href="#footnotece41"><sup>41</sup></a>
We must first<span class="pagenum"><a name="page341" id="page341"></a>[pg 341]</span>
note that both his predecessors&mdash;Palgrave, who was lacking in
'critical faculty', and Ellis, who was 'far from being up to the present
standard of historical scholarship'&mdash;had read this entry rightly, and
given, independently, its gist. It will best enable my readers to
understand the point at issue if I print side by side the paraphrases
of Exeter's offer given by Palgrave and by our author.</p>

<p>I have numbered the clauses in Palgrave's paraphrase which render
the three successive clauses in the Domesday Book entry. The first
refers to the <i>firma</i> of the town, payable to its lord (the king);<a id="footnotetagce43" name="footnotetagce43"></a><a href="#footnotece43"><sup>43</sup></a>
the second to the 'geld' (tax), payable to the king <i>qua</i> king;<a id="footnotetagce44" name="footnotetagce44"></a><a href="#footnotece44"><sup>44</sup></a>
the third to its military service.<a id="footnotetagce45" name="footnotetagce45"></a><a href="#footnotece45"><sup>45</sup></a>
The distinction between the three clauses is admirably seen under Totnes (i. 108, <i>b</i>), and the sense of Domesday
is absolutely certain to any one familiar with its formulas.<a id="footnotetagce46" name="footnotetagce46"></a><a href="#footnotece46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>

<p>The 'commutation of geldability' (as Mr Eyton termed it) was by
no means peculiar to Exeter. Totnes paid, 'when Exeter paid', the
same sum of half a marc 'pro geldo'. Bridport paid the same 'ad opus
Huscarlium regis' (75), Dorchester and Wareham a marc each, and
Shaftesbury two marcs (Eyton's <cite>Dorset Domesday</cite>, 70-72). In these
Dorset instances, one marc represented an assessment of ten hides.</p>

<p>What Mr Freeman did was to confuse the first clause with the
second, and to suppose that both referred to the 'money payment' of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page342" id="page342"></a>[pg 342]</span>
the town, the first under William, the second under Edward. He thus
evolved the statement that under William 'the money payment was
raised from an occasional half-marc of silver to eighteen pounds
yearly'. This is roughly equivalent to saying of a house rented at fifty
pounds, and paying a tax of one pound, that its 'money payment'
was raised from one pound to fifty.</p>

<p>But this confusion, with all its results, is carried further still.
Edith's share of the eighteen pounds is entered in Domesday as
'xii. lib[ras] ad numerum'. This Mr Freeman rightly gave as the
amount in 1086;<a id="footnotetagce47" name="footnotetagce47"></a><a href="#footnotece47"><sup>47</sup></a>
but turning back a few pages, we actually read that</p>

<blockquote><p>
In Domesday twelve houses in Exeter appear as 'liber&aelig; ad numerum in
ministeriis Edid regin&aelig;'.<a id="footnotetagce48" name="footnotetagce48"></a><a href="#footnotece48"><sup>48</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>This is, of course, the same entry, only that here our author changed
pounds into houses, and <i>libras</i> into <i>liber&aelig;</i>. What idea was conveyed to
his mind by a house 'libera ad numerum' I do not profess to explain.
But, oddly enough, as he here turned pounds into houses, so in a
passage of his <cite>William Rufus</cite> he turned houses into pence.<a id="footnotetagce49" name="footnotetagce49"></a><a href="#footnotece49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>

<p>The essence of the whole matter is that the 'burdens' to which
Exeter was subject were not raised at all, but remained precisely the
same as had been paid to former kings. And this fact is the more
notable, because, as Mr Freeman had to admit, 'even the tribute
imposed by William' [on his own hypothesis] 'was not large for so
great a city', and, one may add, a rich one.<a id="footnotetagce50" name="footnotetagce50"></a><a href="#footnotece50"><sup>50</sup></a>
Indeed, it was so small as to fairly call for increase.<a id="footnotetagce51" name="footnotetagce51"></a><a href="#footnotece51"><sup>51</sup></a>
Even Lincoln, which, according to Mr Freeman, received 'favourable' treatment from William, had its
'tribute largely raised'<a id="footnotetagce52" name="footnotetagce52"></a><a href="#footnotece52"><sup>52</sup></a>
in fact, more than trebled.<a id="footnotetagce53" name="footnotetagce53"></a><a href="#footnotece53"><sup>53</sup></a>
What we have to account for, therefore, is the fact that a city which had defied,
insulted, and outraged William, received not only 'a free pardon',<a id="footnotetagce54" name="footnotetagce54"></a><a href="#footnotece54"><sup>54</sup></a>
but peculiar favour at his hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page343" id="page343"></a>[pg 343]</span></p>

<p>The paradox itself is beyond dispute, whatever may be said of my
solution.</p>

<p>For a solution there is. Only it is not to miracles or legends, nor
to the flatterings of courtly chaplains that we must look to learn the
truth, but, in the words of a memorable essay, to 'the few unerring
notices in Domesday and the chronicles'.<a id="footnotetagce55" name="footnotetagce55"></a><a href="#footnotece55"><sup>55</sup></a>
As yet we have not, it must be remembered, heard the story from the English side. Let us
turn, therefore, to the English version, to what Mr Freeman described
as 'the short but weighty account in the Worcester Chronicle,
which gives hints which we should be well pleased to see drawn out
at greater length'.<a id="footnotetagce56" name="footnotetagce56"></a><a href="#footnotece56"><sup>56</sup></a>
These hints I shall now examine, though I
doubt if Mr Freeman's friends will be well pleased with the result.</p>

<p>We have in the Chronicle a straightforward story, not only intelligible
in itself, but also thoroughly in harmony with the known facts
of the case. The king finds himself compelled to lay formal siege to
Exeter ('bes&aelig;t &#254;a burh'); he is detained before its walls day after
day ('xviii. d&aelig;gas') in the depth of an English winter, 'and &#254;&aelig;r wear&#240;
micel his heres forfaren'. The need for sternness was there indeed;
but swiftness was to him, for the moment, a matter of life and death.
Held at bay by those stubborn walls, learning the might of those
'two generals'&mdash;January and February&mdash;in whom the Emperor
Nicholas put his trust, William was in sore straits. Take Mr Freeman's
own words:</p>

<blockquote><p>
The disaffected were intriguing for foreign help;... there was a chance of
his having to struggle for his crown against Swend of Denmark;... men
were everywhere seeking to shake off the yoke, or to escape it in their own
persons. Even where no outbreak took place local conspiracies were rife.<a id="footnotetagce57" name="footnotetagce57"></a><a href="#footnotece57"><sup>57</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Swend was in his rear, half England on his flank; before him reared
their head the walls of dauntless Exeter.<a id="footnotetagce58" name="footnotetagce58"></a><a href="#footnotece58"><sup>58</sup></a>
In that bleak wilderness
of frost and snow his men were falling around him, and, in very
bitterness of spirit, the Conqueror bowed himself for need. So, at
least, I boldly suggest. He fell back on his 'arts of policy', and set
himself to win by alluring terms the men whom he could not conquer.
In the words of the Chronicle, he promised them well ('ac he
heom well behet').</p>

<p>This solution, of course, differs <i>toto c&aelig;lo</i> from Mr Freeman's narrative.
We have seen that he blindly accepted the statements of that
'abandoned flatterer', William of Poitiers (whom Orderic had here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page344" id="page344"></a>[pg 344]</span>
'doubtless followed'<a id="footnotetagce59" name="footnotetagce59"></a><a href="#footnotece59"><sup>59</sup></a>)
&mdash;against whom he elsewhere warned us&mdash;and
combined them with a miracle from William of Malmesbury,
which he euhemerized in the style that he himself had ridiculed in
Thierry.<a id="footnotetagce60" name="footnotetagce60"></a><a href="#footnotece60"><sup>60</sup></a>
And as he could not harmonize the courtly version with
the 'short but weighty account' in the Chronicle he cut the knot by
dismissing the latter, and pronouncing his own version 'the most
likely'.<a id="footnotetagce61" name="footnotetagce61"></a><a href="#footnotece61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>

<p>Resuming the narrative, we learn that the thegns&mdash;the party of
non-resistance from the first&mdash;must have seized this opportunity for
impressing on their 'concives' the necessity of embracing the offer,
whereupon the latter, in the words of the Chronicle, 'gave up the
town because the thegns had betrayed them'. It is just possible that
the word 'geswicon' may point to some direct treachery, but it seems
best and most naturally explained as referring to their unpatriotic
advice, which would naturally appear to English eyes a 'betrayal'
of the national cause. There can be little doubt, from the admissions
of William of Poitiers (through the mouth of Orderic), that the
terms of agreement included not only a free pardon for all past
offences, and for the city's aggravated resistance, but also security
for person and property from plunder by the Norman soldiery.
And the witness of 'the great record' implies that 'the Exeter
patricians', as Mr Freeman styled them<a id="footnotetagce62" name="footnotetagce62"></a><a href="#footnotece62"><sup>62</sup></a>
&mdash;'the civic aristocracy'<a id="footnotetagce63" name="footnotetagce63"></a><a href="#footnotece63"><sup>63</sup></a>
&mdash;gained their original selfish aim, and secured an undertaking that
they should not pay a penny more than their 'tributum ex consuetudine pristina'.</p>

<p>What security, it may be asked, could they obtain for the terms
they seem to have exacted? Bold as it may seem, I would here venture
to read between the lines, and to make the suggestion&mdash;it is
nothing more&mdash;that when there issued from the gates 'the clergy of
the city, bearing their sacred books and other holy things' (as Mr
Freeman rendered the words of Orderic), the real object of their
coming forth was to make the king swear upon their relics<a id="footnotetagce64" name="footnotetagce64"></a><a href="#footnotece64"><sup>64</sup></a>
to the observance of the terms they had obtained. It was indeed the irony
of fate if William, who was ever insisting on the breach of Harold's
oath, was driven, by the force of circumstances, to take such an oath
himself.</p>

<p>But, it may be urged, should we be justified in treating thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page345" id="page345"></a>[pg 345]</span>
drastically the witness of Orderic, or rather, of William of Poitiers?
At Alen&ccedil;on, I reply, in Mr Freeman's words:</p>

<blockquote><p>William of Poitiers is silent altogether, both as to the vengeance and as to
the insult. Neither subject was perhaps altogether agreeable to a professed
panegyrist (<cite>Norm. Conq.</cite>, ii. 285).
</p></blockquote>

<p>Stronger, however, is the case of Le Mans, and more directly to the
point. 'William,' we read, 'followed the same policy against Exeter
(1068) which he had followed against Le Mans' (1063);<a id="footnotetagce65" name="footnotetagce65"></a><a href="#footnotece65"><sup>65</sup></a>
and so, in 1073, we find him 'calling on the men of Le Mans, as he had called
on the men of Exeter', to submit peacefully, and escape his wrath.<a id="footnotetagce66" name="footnotetagce66"></a><a href="#footnotece66"><sup>66</sup></a>
Unlike 'the Exeter patricians', indeed, 'the magistrates of Le
Mans' did receive the king peacefully within their walls; they did
not incur the guilt of offering armed resistance. But the essential
point at Le Mans is that</p>

<blockquote><p>
the Norman version simply tells how they brought the keys of the city, how
they threw themselves on William's mercy, and were graciously received by
him. The local writer speaks in another tone. The interview between the
king and the magistrates of Le Mans is described by a word often used to
express conferences&mdash;in a word, <i>parliaments</i>&mdash;whether between prince and
prince, or between princes and the estates of their dominions. They submitted
themselves to William's authority as their sovereign, but they received
his oath to observe the ancient customs and <i>justices</i> of the city. Le Mans was
no longer to be a sovereign commonwealth, but it was to remain a privileged
municipality.<a id="footnotetagce67" name="footnotetagce67"></a><a href="#footnotece67"><sup>67</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>The words 'acceptis ab eo sacramentis, tam de impunitate perfidi&aelig;
quam de conservandis antiquis ejusdem civitatis consuetudinibus'<a id="footnotetagce68" name="footnotetagce68"></a><a href="#footnotece68"><sup>68</sup></a>
would apply exactly to the case of Exeter, and William may well
have done there what he actually did, we here read, at Le Mans.
There would have been at Exeter even greater need for an oath, in
that its 'perfidia' had been so much the worse.</p>

<p>But now comes the curious parallel. Though quoting and scrutinizing
so closely the meagre accounts of the Exeter campaign, Mr
Freeman seems to have oddly overlooked the significant words of
Florence, although, of course, familiar with his narrative. Florence,
we find, employs a phrase corresponding with that in the <i>Vetera
Analecta</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page346" id="page346"></a>[pg 346]</span>
Mr Freeman argues from the case of Le Mans that <i>dedere</i> in these
times did not imply the fulness of a Roman <i>deditio</i>.<a id="footnotetagce69" name="footnotetagce69"></a><a href="#footnotece69"><sup>69</sup></a>
But we are not merely dependent upon this. The words, 'dextris acceptis', I contend,
imply a promise and a pledge for its performance, and cannot
therefore be reconciled with an unconditional surrender.</p>

<p>Now if it were not for the fortunate preservation of the <i>Vetera
Analecta</i> in the case of Le Mans, Mr Freeman would there also, as at
Exeter, have been hoodwinked by 'the Norman version'.<a id="footnotetagce70" name="footnotetagce70"></a><a href="#footnotece70"><sup>70</sup></a>
I am anxious not to employ a phrase which might be deemed offensive or
unjust, so I restrict myself to that which he himself applied to his
predecessor, Palgrave, when, speaking of the story of Eadric and his
brother, he wrote that Sir Francis Palgrave 'swallowed the whole
tale'.<a id="footnotetagce71" name="footnotetagce71"></a><a href="#footnotece71"><sup>71</sup></a>
Whether my solution be accepted or not, it is, I repeat, conjectural.
I have, at least, shown that there is a mystery to be solved,
that Mr Freeman's version fails to solve it, and that, so far from
Domesday recording the punishment inflicted upon Exeter, it actually
heightens the mystery of the case by proving that Exeter
obtained exceptionally favourable treatment.</p>

<p>It is not merely a question of how Exeter fell. The issue illustrates
the policy and affects the character of William. The lame manner in
which Mr Freeman accounts for his sudden conversion from fury to
lamb-like gentleness is no less unsatisfactory than his treatment of the
'weighty account' in the Chronicle when he found that this, his
valued authority, rendered the problem difficult. Even at Le Mans
more was needed than merely to print both stories. The fact that we
find in 'the Norman version' the truth conveniently glossed over
ought to be insisted on and duly applied. Time after time in Mr
Freeman's work we find him paraphrasing patches of chronicles,
under the impression that he was writing history. The statements of
witnesses are laid before us, neatly pieced together, but they are not
subjected to more than a perfunctory cross-examination. Even if the
accurate reproduction of testimony were all that we sought from the
historian, we should not, so far as Domesday is concerned, obtain it
in this instance. But the case of Exeter is one where something more
is needed, where even accuracy is not sufficient without the possession
of that higher gift, the power of seizing upon the truth when the evidence
is misleading and contradictory. The paraphrasing of evidence
is the work of a reporter; from the historian we have a right to expect
the skilled summing-up of the judge.</p>

Mr Freeman rendered it 'neighbouring shires', but I am not at all sure that,
taken in conjunction with the words just before about the accessibility of Exeter
from Ireland and Brittany, and those just after, about 'mercatores advenas',

<h3>THE ALLEGED DESTRUCTION OF LEICESTER</h3>

<p class="title1c">(1068)</p>

<p>This question was raised and discussed by Mr Freeman in his
<cite>History of the Norman Conquest</cite> (iv. 196-7). We there read as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Is it possible that in the case of Leicester, at least, no power was left either
to follow or to resist? While we have no evidence either way on which we can
rely with confidence, one of those secondary and local records, which sometimes
contain fragments of authentic tradition, suggests, in a perfectly casual
way, that a doom fell upon Leicester, which might, doubtless, with some
exaggeration, be spoken of as utter destruction. And this incidental hint may
perhaps draw some indirect confirmation from the highest evidence of all
[Domesday] ... and it may be that Leicester earned its overthrow by a
defence worthy of a borough which was to give its name to the greatest of
England's later worthies.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The 'record' referred to is quoted in a footnote, and is a history of
the foundation of Leicester Abbey, one of a class of narratives
notoriously inaccurate and corrupt:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Robertus Comes Mellenti, veniens in Angliam cum Willelmo Duce
Normanni&aelig;, adeptus consulatum Leycestri&aelig;, ex dono dicti Ducis et Conquestoris
Angli&aelig;, <i>destructa prius civitate Leicestri&aelig;</i> cum castello et ecclesia infra
castellum tempore pr&aelig;dicti Conquestoris, re&aelig;dificavit ipsam &aelig;cclesiam
Sancta Mari&aelig; infra castellum.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, it strikes one in the first place as somewhat unlikely that
William, on his arrival at Leicester, should find a castle to destroy.
But, further, how could Robert have obtained the 'consulatus' of
Leicester from the Conqueror, when he is well known to have first
obtained it (under very peculiar circumstances) from Henry I?
If this known event has been so glaringly ante-dated, may not
the alleged 'destruction' be so likewise? These it may be said are only
doubts. But, as it happens, we can not only discredit the suggested
'destruction' in the days of the Conqueror: we can actually fix its
date as the reign of Henry I.</p>

<p>We learn from Orderic that the town of Leicester ('urbs Legrecestria')
was divided into four quarters, of which Ivo de Grantmesnil
possessed two, one in his own right, and one (which was the King's
share) as the King's reeve and representative. We also learn that he
was among the 'seditiosi proceres', who rebelled against Henry in
1101, and that of these, 'aliqui contra fideles vicinos guerram arripuerunt
et gremium alm&aelig; telluris rapacitatibus et incendiis, cruentisque
c&aelig;dibus maculaverunt'. Ivo is again mentioned by Orderic in
1102, not only among the 'proditores' of the previous year, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page348" id="page348"></a>[pg 348]</span>
were now called to account, but also as a special ringleader in that
internecine conflict to which he had already referred. He tells us
that Henry</p>

<blockquote><p>
Ivonem quoque, quia guerram in Anglia c&oelig;perat et vicinorum rura suorum
incendia combusserat (quod in illa regione crimen est inusitatum nec sine
grave ultione fit expiatum), rigidus censor accusatum nec purgatum ingentis
pecuni&aelig; redditione oneravit, et plurimo angore tribulatum m&aelig;stificavit.
</p></blockquote>

<p>In short, as Dr Stubbs reminds us, Ivo 'has the evil reputation of being
the first to introduce the horrors of private warfare into England'.
Bearing in mind the divided authority from which Leicester suffered,
and the statement that Ivo, ruling half the town, plundered and
made fierce war upon his neighbours, we arrive at the conclusion
that the 'destruction', which, in the <cite>Monasticon</cite> narrative, precedes
the accession of the Count of Meulan to the <i>comitatus</i> of Leicester,
may be assigned, without a shadow of doubt, to the struggle of 1101.</p>

<p>On Ivo's disgrace, as is well known, the wily Count stepped at
once into his shoes, 'et auxilio regis su&acirc;que calliditate totam sibi
civitatem mancipavit, et inde consul in Anglia factus'. There is no
reason to doubt the statement that St Mary 'de Castro' was rebuilt
and refounded by Count Robert after his obtaining this position at
Leicester.</p>

<p>It is singular that just as the <cite>Monasticon</cite> seems to have misled Mr
Freeman at Leicester, so it is responsible for Thierry's 'story of the
fighting monks of Oxford', at about the same time, a story of which
Mr Freeman wrote that 'the whole story is a dream', and 'would not
have been allowable even in an historical novel' (iv. 779-80).</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page349" id="page349"></a>[pg 349]</span></p>

<hr class="medium" />

<h3>ELY AND HER DESPOILERS</h3><!-- ed -->

<p class="title1c">(1072-5)</p>

<p>The elaborate record of this trial is only found, I believe, in the
Trinity College (Cambridge) MS., O. 2, 1 (fos. 210<i>b</i>-213<i>b</i>) from
which it has been printed by Mr Hamilton in his <cite>Inquisitio Comitatus Cantabrigiensis</cite>
(pp. 192-5). This 'placitum', therefore, would seem
to have remained unknown till the publication of that work (1876).</p>

<p>The date of this important document can be fixed within a few
years. It mentions Earl Waltheof among those before whom the plea
was held, so that it cannot be later than 1075; and as it also mentions
'Rodulfus comes', it is evidently previous to the revolt of the earls in
that year. On the other hand, it is later than the death of William
Malet, for it mentions his son Robert as in possession, and later,
therefore, than the restoration of Waltheof at the beginning of 1070.
Moreover, it is subsequent to the death of Stigand ('post obitum
illius'). Now Stigand was not even deposed till the spring of 1070;
and we know from Domesday and other sources that he lived some
time afterwards. We may safely say, therefore, that this 'placitum'
did not take place till after the suppression of the Ely revolt in the
autumn of 1071. Practically, therefore, our document belongs to the
years 1072-1075. Now, as Abbot Thurstan did not die till 1076&mdash;the
date given in the <cite>Liber Eliensis</cite>, and accepted by Mr Freeman&mdash;it
follows that this great act of restitution in favour of the Abbey
took place under Abbot Thurstan himself, a fact unmentioned by the
chroniclers, and unsuspected by Mr Freeman, who held that he
found no favour in William's eyes.</p>

<p>The great length of this document&mdash;so important for its bearing
on Domesday&mdash;precludes its discussion in detail. But its opening
clause must be given and some of its features pointed out.</p>

<blockquote><p>
Ad illud placitum quo pontifices Gosfridus et Remigius, consul vero
Waltheuus, necnon vicecom[ites] Picotus atque Ilbertus jussu Willelmi
Dei dispositione Anglor[um] regis, cum omni vicecomitatu sicut rex preceperat,
convenerunt, testimonio hominum rei veritatem cognoscentium determinaverunt
terras que injuste fuerant ablate ab ecclesia sancte Dei genitricis
Marie de insul&acirc; ely ... quatinus de dominio fuerant, tempore videlicet regis
&AElig;dwardi, ad dominium sine alicujus contradictione redirent quicunque eas
possideret.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The mention of Count Eustace among those withholding lands
proves that at the date of this document he was already restored to
his possessions. Another individual whose name occurs several times
in this document is Lisois ('De Monasteriis'), the hero of the passage
of the Aire. Collating its evidence with that of Domesday, we find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page350" id="page350"></a>[pg 350]</span>
that Lisois had been succeeded, at the date of the great record, by
the well-known Eudo Dapifer in a fief, ranging over at least five
counties&mdash;Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, and Essex&mdash;in
all of which Domesday records his name as the predecessor of
Eudo. This is of the more interest because Mr Freeman wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>
The only notice of this Lisois which I can find in Domesday is in ii. 49<i>b</i>,
where he appears in possession, but seemingly illegal possession, of a small
holding in Essex.
</p></blockquote>

<p>So again we have in our document this passage relating to Stigand:</p>

<blockquote><p>
He sunt proprie ville monasterii insule Ely quos Stigandus archipresul
tenebat, unde per annum victum fratribus reddidit tantum quantum
pertinet ad hoc. Has vero tenet rex noster W. post obitum illius, Methelwald
et Crokestune et Snegelwelle et Dictun.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Now Stigand, according to the <cite>Liber Eliensis</cite> 'quasdam illius optimas
possessiones sicut Liber Terrarum insinuat, ad maximum loci dispendium
retinuit'. Our document identifies these 'possessiones' with
Methwold and Croxton in Norfolk, Snailwell and Ditton in Cambridgeshire,
and thus disposes of Mr Freeman's very unfortunate
suggestion&mdash;advanced, of course, to justify Stigand&mdash;that the <cite>Liber Eliensis</cite>
here referred to a tiny Hampshire estate, which the Abbey
had held under Stigand T.R.E.<a id="footnotetaged1" name="footnotetaged1"></a><a href="#footnoteed1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>In my paper on Domesday I have pointed out the importance of
this document in its bearing on socmen and their services, while we
saw in investigating knight service that its language affords, in this
matter, a valuable gloss on that of Domesday. Close examination of
its details shows that the aggressions on the Abbey's property which
it records, were, in spite of the verdict on this occasion, persisted in,
if not increased. Those, for instance, of Hardwin may be recognized
in the duplicate entries in Domesday Book, representing the conflicting
claims.<a id="footnotetaged2" name="footnotetaged2"></a><a href="#footnoteed2"><sup>2</sup></a>
On persons as on lands we have some fresh information.
Ilbert the Sheriff was, I believe, identical with that 'Ilbert de Hertford',
who is alluded to in Domesday (i. 200), and would thus be a
pre-Domesday Sheriff of Herts.<a id="footnotetaged3" name="footnotetaged3"></a><a href="#footnoteed3"><sup>3</sup></a>
The entry, 'tenet Rotbertus homo
Bainardi in Reoden de soca', when compared with the holding of
'Rienduna' by Ralf 'Baignardi' in Domesday (ii. 414), suggests that
we have in Bainard the father (hitherto unknown) of this Domesday
tenant-in-chief. Bainard would thus be a Christian name, as was
also Mainard, which occurs in this same document.</p>

Domesday (i. 200<i>b</i>) styles him, 'Ilbertus de Hertford', and connects him with
'Risedene', a Hertfordshire Manor. On the other hand, the I.C.C. makes him
'Ilbertus de Hereforda' (p. 56), and 'Ilbertus vicecomes' is actually found in
Herefordshire (D.B., i. 179<i>b</i>). But what could he be doing in Cambridgeshire?</p>

<h3>THE LORDS OF ARDRES</h3><!-- la -->

<p>In the <cite>History of the Norman Conquest</cite> (2nd ed.) we read of Eustace of
Boulogne:</p>

<blockquote><p>
An incidental notice of one of his followers throws some light on the class
of men who flocked to William's banners, and on the rewards which they
received. One Geoffrey, an officer of the Abbey of Saint Bertin at Saint
Omer, who had the charge of its possessions in the County of Guines, sent
his sons, Arnold and Geoffrey, to the war ... and in the end they received
a grant of lands both in Essex and in the border shires of Mercia and East-Anglia,
under the superiority of their patron Count Eustace (iii. 314).
</p></blockquote>

<p>In an Appendix on 'Arnold of Ardres', which Mr Freeman devoted
to this subject (iii. 725-6), he gave the 'Historia Comitum Ardensium'
(of Lambert of Ardres) for his authority, and he verified, by
Domesday, the Manors which Lambert assigns to 'these adventurers',
holding that a Bedfordshire estate was omitted, while
'Stebintonia', which he identified with Stibbington, Hunts, was
wrongly included, as it was 'held of Count Eustace by Lunen'.</p>

<p>The first point to be noticed here is that 'these adventurers' were
the sons (as Lambert explains) not of any 'Geoffrey', a mere Abbey
officer, but of a local magnate, Arnold, Lord of Ardres. The next is
that Lambert was quite correct in his list of Manors.</p>

<p>In the fourth series of his historical essays Mr Freeman included a
paper on 'The Lords of Ardres', for which he availed himself of Dr
Heller's edition of Lambert in the <cite>Monumenta</cite> (vol. xxiv). In this
edition the passage runs:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Feodum Stevintoniam et pertinencias eius, Dokeswordiam, Tropintoniam,
Leilefordiam, Toleshondiam, et Hoilandiam (cap. 113, p. 615).
</p></blockquote>

<p>Dr Heller, on this, notes:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Secundum 'Domesday Book' recepit Ernulfus de Arda Dochesworde,
Trupintone (com. Cantabrig.) et Stiventone (comit. Bedford) a comite
Eustacio ... e contra Toheshunt [<i>sic</i>] Hoiland, Leleford recepit ab eodem
comite Adelolfus de Merc (prope Calais).
</p></blockquote>

<p>This note enabled Mr Freeman to identify 'Adelolfus' (which he had
failed to do in the <cite>Norman Conquest</cite>), though he must have overlooked
the identification of 'Stevintonia' (namely Stevington, Beds.), for we
find him still writing:</p>

<blockquote><p>
But of the English possessions reckoned up by our author two only ... can
be identified in Domesday as held by Arnold ... The local writer seems to
have mixed up the possessions of Arnold with those of a less famous adventurer
from the same reign, Adelolf&mdash;our Athelwulf&mdash;of Merck (pp. 184-5).
</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page352" id="page352"></a>[pg 352]</span></p>

<p>And he again insisted that 'Arnold had other lands in Bedfordshire'.</p>

<p>We will now turn to an entry in the <cite>Testa de Nevill</cite> from the 'milites
tenentes de honore Bononie':</p>

<blockquote><p>
Comes de Gines tenet xii. milites, scilicet&mdash;in Bedefordescire, in <i>Stiveton</i> et
Parva Wahull <span class="sc">iii</span> milites, in Cantabr' in <i>Dukesword</i>, et <i>Trumpeton</i> <span class="sc">iii</span> milites
... in Essex, <i>Tholehunt</i> et Galdhangr' <span class="sc">iii</span> milites, in <i>Hoyland'</i> et <i>Lalesford</i>
ibidem <span class="sc">iii</span> milites.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Here we have all the Manors mentioned by Lambert (with their
appurtenances) assigned to the Count of Guines, the heir of Arnold
of Ardres; and we can thus believe the <cite>Testa</cite> entry (p. 272) of
Tolleshunt and Holland, 'quas idem comes et antecessores sui
tenuerunt de conquestu Angli&aelig;'. But the <cite>Testa</cite> does more than this;
it informs us that Holland and Lawford were held of the Count by
'Henry de Merk'. Now, 'Adelolf' de Merk is found in Domesday
holding many Manors direct from Eustace of Boulogne, and these
Manors are divided in the <cite>Testa</cite> between his descendants Simon and
Henry de Merk.<a id="footnotetagla1" name="footnotetagla1"></a><a href="#footnotela1"><sup>1</sup></a>
It is, therefore, possible that he held the three
Essex Manors in 1086, not directly from Count Eustace, but, like
his descendant, from their under-tenant (Arnold). This raises, of
course, an important question as to Domesday.<a id="footnotetagla2" name="footnotetagla2"></a><a href="#footnotela2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>It is interesting to observe that the village of Marck in the Pas de
Calais has, through Adelolf and his heirs, transferred its name to the
Essex parish of Mark's Tey, though not to that of Marks Hall (so
named in Domesday).</p>

<p>While on the subject of the Lords of Ardres, it may be convenient
to give the reference to a letter of mine to the <cite>Academy</cite> (May 28,
1892), explaining that Lambert's 'Albericus Aper', who puzzled Dr
Heller and Mr Freeman, was our own Aubrey de Vere, first Earl of
Oxford, and that Lambert's statement (accepted by Mr Freeman)
as to the parentage of Emma, wife of Count Manasses, had been
disproved by Stapleton.</p>

<p class="footnote1"><a id="footnotela1" name="footnotela1"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotetagla1"><sup>1</sup></a>
An interesting charter belonging to the close of Stephen's reign shows us
Queen Matilda compensating Henry 'de Merch' for his land at Donyland (one
of these Manors)&mdash;which she was giving to St John's, Colchester&mdash;'de redditibus
transmarinis ad suam voluntatem'. Another and earlier charter from her father
and mother (printed by Mr E. J. L. Scott in the <cite>Athen&aelig;um</cite> of December 2, 1893)
has Fulco de merc and M. de merc among the witnesses.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="footnotela2" name="footnotela2"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotetagla2"><sup>2</sup></a>
The non-appearance of Arnold's brother, 'Geoffrey', in Domesday which has
been deemed a difficulty, is accounted for by Lambert's statement that he made
over his English possessions to Arnold.</p>

<h3>EARLY IRISH TRADE WITH CHESTER AND ROUEN<a id="footnotetagir1" name="footnotetagir1"></a><a href="#footnoteir1"><sup>1</sup></a></h3><!-- ir -->

<p>The eighth report of the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts
speaks of the records of the city of Chester as 'beginning with
Henry the Second's writ of licence to the citizens of Chester to trade
in Durham [<i>sic</i>] as they were wont to do in the time of Henry the
First' (p. xv). The records themselves are similarly described in the
actual report on them (pp. 355-403) as 'beginning with a curious
writ, addressed by Henry the Second to his bailiffs of the city of
Durham' [<i>sic</i>]. This, which is among those items spoken of as
'especially interesting and important', figures thus as the head of
the calendar:</p>

<blockquote><p>
(1) Henry II. Licence to the burgesses of Chester to buy and sell at
Durham [<i>sic</i>] as they were wont to do in the time of Henry I&mdash;'Henricus
Dei gratia Rex Anglie et Dux Normannie et Aquitanie et Comes Andegavie
balluis [<i>sic</i>] de Dunelina [<i>sic</i>] salutem:&mdash;Precipio quod Burgenses Cestrie
possint emere et vendere ad detaillum [<i>or</i> doraillum] apud Dunelinam [<i>sic</i>]
habendo et faciendo easdem consuetudines quas faciebant tempore Regis
Henrici avi mei et easdem ibi habeant rectitudines et libertates et liberas
consuetudines quas tempore illo habere solebant, teste, Willelmo filio Ald'
dapifero Apud Wintoniam.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Durham is not only a most improbable place for such a writ to refer
to, but is also an impossible rendering of the Latin name. The
interest and importance of this 'curious writ' has, in short, been
obscured and lost through the ignorance of Mr J. C. Jeaffreson, to
whom the report was entrusted. The charters which follow the writ,
and which are printed on the same page, refer to this writ as relating
to Ireland; and the town, of course, to which it refers is not Durham
but Dublin (<i>Duuelina</i>).</p>

<p>We have, therefore, in this writ an almost, if not quite, unique
reference by Henry II to Dublin in the days of his grandfather,
and a confirmation of the 'libertates', etc., which the men of
Chester had then enjoyed there, just as if his grandfather had been in
his own position. Secondly, we have here record evidence, not
merely of a recognized connection, but of what might be termed
treaty relations between the traders of Chester and the Ostmen of
Dublin, long previous to the Conquest of Ireland, thus confirming
Mr Green's observation, 'the port of Chester depended on the trade
with Ireland, which had sprung up since the settlement of the Northmen
along the Irish Coasts'.<a id="footnotetagir2" name="footnotetagir2"></a><a href="#footnoteir2"><sup>2</sup></a>
And this has, of course, a bearing on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page354" id="page354"></a>[pg 354]</span>
the question of 'a Danish settlement' at Chester. Thirdly, we learn
from this document that at the date of its issue Dublin was governed
by bailiffs of the King (<i>ballivi sui</i>).</p>

<p>What, then, was its date? The clue, unfortunately, is slight; but it
may not improbably belong to the close of 1175 or early part of 1176.
This brings us to the interesting question, why was such a writ
issued? Remembering that during his stay at Dublin (November
1171-January 1172) Henry II had granted that city to his men of
Bristol, we may hold it in accordance with the spirit of the time,
and, indeed, a matter of virtual certainty, that Bristol would have
striven on the strength of this grant to exclude 'its rival port' (<cite>Conquest
of England</cite>, p. 443) from the benefits of the Dublin trade.
Chester would, therefore, appeal to the King on the strength of its
antecedent rights, and would thus have obtained from him this
writ, recognizing and confirming their validity.</p>

<p>The Domesday customs of the city (i. 262<i>b</i>) contain a curious
allusion to its Irish trade:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Si habentibus martrinas pelles juberet prepositus regis ut nulli venderet
donec sibi prius ostensas compararet, qui hoc non observabat xl. solidis
emendabat ... H&aelig;c civitas tunc reddebat de firma xlv. lib et iii. timbres
pellium martrinium.
</p></blockquote>

<p>There is nothing to show where these marten skins came from, or why
they are mentioned under Chester alone. But on turning to the
customs of Rouen, as recorded in the charters of Duke Henry
(1150-1) and King John (1199), we find they were imported from
Ireland.</p>

<blockquote><p>
Qu&aelig;cunque navis de Hibernia venerit, ex quo caput de Gernes [Guernsey]
transierit, Rothomagum veniat, unde ego habeam de unaqu&acirc;que nave unum
tymbrium de martris aut decem libras Rothomagi, si ejusdem navis mercatores
jurare poterint se ideo non mercatos fuisse illas martras ut auferrent
consuetudinem ducis Normanni&aelig;, et vicecomes Rothomagi de unaquaque
habeat viginti solidos Rothomagi et Camerarius Tancarvill&aelig; unam accipitrem
aut sexdecim solidos Rothomagi.</p></blockquote>

<p>Giraldus Cambrensis, it may be remembered, alludes to the abundance
of martens in Ireland,<a id="footnotetagir3" name="footnotetagir3"></a><a href="#footnoteir3"><sup>3</sup></a>
and describes how they were captured.
We thus have evidence in Domesday of the Irish trade with Chester,
even in the days of Edward the Confessor.</p>

<h3>WALTER TIREL AND HIS WIFE</h3><!-- wt -->

<p>In his detailed examination of all the evidence bearing on the death
of William Rufus, the late Mr Freeman carefully collected the few
facts that are known relative to Walter Tirel. They are, however, so
few that he could add nothing to what Lappenberg had set forth
(ii. 207) in 1834. He was, however, less confident than his predecessor
as to the identity of Walter Tirel with the Essex tenant of
that name in Domesday. I hope now to establish the facts beyond
dispute, to restore the identity of Walter Tirel, and also to show for
the first time who his wife really was.</p>

<p>The three passages we have first to consider are these, taking
them in the same order as Mr Freeman:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Adelidam filiam Ricardi de sublimi prosapia Gifardorum conjugem
habuit, qu&aelig; Hugonem de Pice, strenuissimum militem, marito suo peperit
(<cite>Ord. Vit.</cite>).</p>

<p>Laingaham tenet Walterus Tirelde R. quod tenuit Phin dacus pro ii.
hidis et dimidia et pro uno manerio (<cite>Domesday</cite>, ii. 41).</p>

<p>Adeliz uxor Walteri Tirelli reddit compotum de x. marcis argenti de
eisdem placitis de La Wingeham (<cite>Rot. Pip.</cite>, 31 Hen. I).
</p></blockquote>

<p>Dealing first with the Domesday entry, which comes, as Mr
Freeman observed, 'among the estates of Richard of Clare', I would
point out that though Ellis (who misled Mr Freeman) thought that
'Tirelde' was the name, the right reading is 'tenet Walterus Tirel de
R[icardo]', two words (as is not unusual) being written as one.
Turning next to the words of Orderic, we find that Lappenberg
renders them 'Adelaide, Tochter des Richard Giffard', and Mr
Freeman as 'a wife Adelaide by name, of the great line of Giffard'.
But there is no trace of a Richard Giffard, nor can 'Adelida' herself
be identified among the Giffards. The explanation of the mystery, I
hold, is that she was the daughter, not of a Giffard, but of Richard
<em>de Clare</em>, by his wife Rohese, daughter of Walter Giffard the elder.
It is noteworthy that Orderic employs a precisely similar expression
in the case of another Adeliza, the daughter of Robert de Grentmesnil.
He terms her 'soror Hugonis de Grentemaisnil de clara stirpe
Geroianorum', though she was only descended from the famous
Geroy through her mother. Richard's daughter was sufficiently
described as 'Adelida filia Ricardi', just as her brothers were known
as 'Gilbertus filius Ricardi', 'Rogerus filius Ricardi', etc. The position
of that mighty family was such that this description was enough, and
they were even known collectively as the 'Ricardi', or 'Richardenses'
(<cite>Mon. Ang.</cite>, iv. 609). This is well illustrated by the passage in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page356" id="page356"></a>[pg 356]</span>
Ely writer, describing Adeliza's brother Richard, Abbot of Ely, as</p>

<blockquote><p>
parentum undique grege vallatus, quorum familiam ex Ricardis et Gifardis
constare tota Anglia et novit et sensit. Ricardi enim et Gifardi, du&aelig; scilicet
ex propinquo venientes famili&aelig;, virtutis fama et generis copia illustres
effecerat.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The above forms are curious, but not without parallel. Thus the
descendants of Urse d'Abetot are spoken of as 'Ursini' in Heming's
Cartulary. &AElig;thelred of Rievaulx speaks of 'Poncii' and 'Morini' as
present at the battle of the Standard; Gerald, in a well-known
passage (v. 335), speaks of the 'Giraldid&aelig;' and 'Stephanid&aelig;', and
Orderic, we have seen, of the 'Geroiani'.</p>

<p>The doubly influential character of this descent is well illustrated
in this passage (<cite>quantum valeat</cite>) from the chronicle of St John's Abbey,
Colchester.</p>

<blockquote><p>
Parcebatur tamen Eudoni, propter genus uxoris ipsius Rohais&aelig;: erat
enim h&aelig;c de genere nobilissimo Normannorum, filia scilicet Ricardi, qui
fuit filius Gilbert Comitis, duxitque Rohaisam uxorem, qu&aelig; erat soror
Willelmi Giffardi, Episcopi Wintoni&aelig;. Itaque, cum fratres et propinqui
junioris Rohais&aelig; quoslibet motus machinaturi putarentur, si contra maritum
ipsius aliquid durius decerneretur, sic factum est ut interventu predicti
Episcopi, etc., etc.
</p></blockquote>

<p>This passage is, I believe, the sole evidence for the real parentage of
Bishop William. It was clearly unknown to Canon Venables, who
wrote the Bishop's life for the <cite>Dictionary of National Biography</cite>.</p>

<p>Like most of these 'foundation' histories, this document is in part
untrustworthy. But it is Dugdale who has misread it, and not the
document itself that is responsible for the grave error (<cite>Baronage</cite>, i.
110) that Eudo's wife was 'Rohese, daughter of Walter Giffard, Earl
of Buckingham'. Here again, as in the Tirel case, the daughter of a
Clare, by a Giffard, is converted into a Giffard. The error arose from
referring the 'qui' to Eudo instead of to his father-in-law, Richard.
The 'Historia' is perfectly consistent throughout in its identification
of the younger Rohese, of whom it states that 'commorata est marito
annis triginta duobus, cui ante habiles annos nupta est' (iv. 609).</p>

<p>In asserting under 'Clare' (<cite>Baronage</cite>, i. 208) that Eudo married
the widow (not the daughter) of Richard, Dugdale relied on
another and more inaccurate document (<cite>Mon. Ang.</cite>, v. 269) which
actually does speak of</p>

<blockquote><p>
Rohesia una sororum Walteri [Giffard secundi]&mdash;duas plures enim habuit&mdash;conjuncta
in matrimonio Ricardo filio Gilberti, qui in re militari, tempore
Conquestoris, omnes sui temporis magnates pr&aelig;cessit&mdash;
</p></blockquote>

<p>as marrying Eudo Dapifer after her husband's death. But we must
decide in favour of the Colchester narrative: Eudo's wife was her
daughter and namesake.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page357" id="page357"></a>[pg 357]</span></p>

<p>We see then that Walter Tirel was son-in-law to Richard de
Clare, who had enfeoffed him in 'Laingaham' before 1086. Now this
'Laingaham' was Langham in Essex, just north of Colchester, which
gives us an important clue. Walter's widow 'Adeliz' was in possession
in 1130 (<cite>Rot. Pip.</cite>, Hen. I) because, as we have seen, it was probably
given her by her father 'in maritagio'. But her son Hugh held it
under Stephen, and Anstis saw among the muniments of the Duchy
of Lancaster a mortgage of it by Hugh to Gervase 'Justiciar of
London'. I have not yet identified this 'mortgage', but the confirmation
of it to Gervase de Cornhill by Earl Gilbert de Clare, as
chief lord of the fee, is extant,<a id="footnotetagwt1" name="footnotetagwt1"></a><a href="#footnotewt1"><sup>1</sup></a>
and its first witness is Earl Gilbert of
Pembroke, so that it cannot be later than 1148, or earlier than 1138
(or 1139). Moreover in yet another quarter (Lansdown MS. 203,
15 dors.) we find a copy of a charter by this latter Earl Gilbert,
belonging to the same occasion, which runs as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Com. Gilb. de Penbroc omnibus hominibus Francis et Anglis sal. Sciatis
me concessisse illam convencionem et vendicionem quam Hugo Tirell fecit
Gervasio de Chorhella de manerio suo de Laingham parte mea. Nam
Comes de Clara ex parte sua illud idem concessit, de cuius feodo predictum
manerium movet.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Both charters contain the curious 'movet' formula, in England so
rare that I think I have not met with any other instance. It is, of
course, equivalent to the regular French phrase: 'sous sa mouvance'.
This mortgage or sale was probably effected as a preliminary to the
crusade of 1147, in which Hugh Tirel is known to have taken part.
Now the above Gervase, as I have shown in my <cite>Geoffrey de Mandeville</cite>,
was no other than Gervase de Cornhill, and after his death we find
Langham duly in the possession of his son, Henry de Cornhill.<a id="footnotetagwt2" name="footnotetagwt2"></a><a href="#footnotewt2"><sup>2</sup></a> The
chain of evidence is thus complete, and the identity of the Tirels
and of their Manor placed beyond question.</p>

<p>But returning to the parentage of Walter's wife, we find that it
raises a curious question by the family circle to which it introduces
us. For we now learn that Gilbert and Roger, sons of Richard de
Clare, who were present at Brockenhurst when the King was killed,
were brothers-in-law of Walter Tirel, while Richard, another
brother-in-law, was promptly selected to be Abbot of Ely by Henry I,
who further gave the see of Winchester, as his first act, to William
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page358" id="page358"></a>[pg 358]</span>
Giffard, another member of the same powerful family circle.<a id="footnotetagwt3" name="footnotetagwt3"></a><a href="#footnotewt3"><sup>3</sup></a>
Moreover, the members of the house of Clare were in constant
attendance at Henry's court, and 'Eudo Dapifer', whose wife was a
Clare, was one of his favourites. I do not say that all this points to
some secret conspiracy, to which Henry was privy, but it shows at
least that he was on excellent terms with Walter Tirel's relatives.</p>

<p>I have explained in my article on the Clares in the <cite>Dictionary of
National Biography</cite> that there has been much confusion as to the
family history. As the errors are very persistent, it may perhaps be of
some service, especially for identifying names, if I append a pedigree
for the period of the Tirel connection, which will distinguish the
descendants of Count Gilbert, 'illustrious in his forefathers and his
descendants'.</p>

<p>Two charters will illustrate the attendance of the family at court
in the early days of Henry I. An interesting charter belonging to
Christmas, 1101, is attested by 'Gislebertus filius Ricardi et Robertus
filius Baldwini et Ricardus frater ejus', while the attestations to one
of September 3, 1101, comprise 'G[islebertus] filius R[icardi]
R[ogerus] (or R[obertus]) frater suus W[alterus] frater suus.... R[obertus]
(or R[icardus]) filius B[aldwini].'<a id="footnotetagwt4" name="footnotetagwt4"></a><a href="#footnotewt4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>Among the most persistent of errors are those which identify
Richard 'filius Baldwini' with Richard de Redvers (who was of a
different family and died long before him), and which make this
compound Richard an Earl of Devon.</p>

<p>Planch&eacute; endeavoured to slay the former of these errors&mdash;which,
originating in the <cite>Monasticon</cite>, is embalmed in Dugdale's <cite>Baronage</cite>&mdash;as
Taylor had previously done in his 'Wace', and the Duchess of
Cleveland has rightly observed in her <cite>Battle Abbey Roll</cite> (1889) that
'there is not the slightest authority for assuming' the identity. But the
necessity for again correcting the error is shown by its reappearance
in Mr Freeman's <cite>Exeter</cite> (1887) and by the life of Baldwin de Redvers,
in the <cite>Dictionary of National Biography</cite>, by Mr Hunt, which begins by
stating that he was 'the eldest son of Richard, Earl of Devon, the son
of Baldwin de Moeles', whereas his father was not an Earl, and was
not the son of Baldwin de Moeles.</p>

<p>I may also take this opportunity of pointing out that (as is shown
in my <cite>Geoffrey de Mandeville</cite>) Richard fitz Gilbert (d. 1136) was not an
earl, the earldom of Herts having been ante-dated like that of Devon.</p>

<p>Dugdale again has omitted, because he failed to identify, another
daughter of the house of Clare, who made a most interesting match.
This was 'Adelidis de Tunbridge', wife of William de Percy, a niece
and namesake, I confidently suggest, of Walter Tirel's wife. She
seems to have brought into the Percy family the names of Richard
and Walter. The charters which establish, I think, her identity are
those of Sallay Abbey, in which Maud (widow of William, Earl of
Warwick) and her sister Agnes (ancestress of the later Percies) speak
of their mother as 'Adelidis de Tunbridge' (<cite>Mon. Ang.</cite>, v. 512-13).
She can only, therefore, in my opinion, have been a daughter of
Gilbert 'de Tunbridge'; and with this conclusion the dates harmonize
well. Yet another daughter was Margaret, wife of William de Montfichet,
who brought into that family the names of Gilbert and
Richard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page359" id="page359"></a>[pg 359]</span></p>

<p>We have yet to deal with one more member of this historic house,
Baldwin fitz Gilbert, or Baldwin de Clare, ancestor, through his
daughter and heir, of the family of Wake. I had always suspected
that Baldwin fitz Gilbert, the recognized grandfather of Baldwin
Wac (1166), could be no other than Baldwin, son of Gilbert de
Clare, a well-known man. But Dugdale, under 'Wake' (i. 539) positively
asserts that the former was 'brother to Walter de Gant, father
of Gilbert de Gant, the first Earl of Lincoln of that family'. This
proves, however, on inquiry, to be based on an almost incredible
blunder. Dugdale actually relied on a charter,<a id="footnotetagwt5" name="footnotetagwt5"></a><a href="#footnotewt5"><sup>5</sup></a>
which includes Baldwin
among the Clares, and which he himself under 'Clare' rightly so
interprets (<cite>Baronage</cite>, i. 207<i>b</i>). There is, therefore, no ground for
deriving Baldwin from De Gant, or for rejecting his identity with
that Baldwin <em>de Clare</em>, who addressed the troops on behalf of Stephen
at the battle of Lincoln.<a id="footnotetagwt6" name="footnotetagwt6"></a><a href="#footnotewt6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>Having made several additions to the pedigree of De Clare, I have
also to make one deduction in Robert fitz Richard's alleged younger
son 'Simon, to whom he gave the Lordship of Daventry in Northamptonshire'
(<cite>Baronage</cite>, i. 218). This erroneous statement is taken
from a monastic genealogy (blundering as usual) in the Daventry
Cartulary.<a id="footnotetagwt7" name="footnotetagwt7"></a><a href="#footnotewt7"><sup>7</sup></a>
The documents of that house show at once that Simon
was the son of Robert fitz 'Vitalis' (a benefactor to the house in
1109), not of Robert fitz Richard, and was not, therefore, a Clare.
Nor was he lord of Daventry.</p>

<p>But Dugdale's most unpardonable blunder is his identification of
Maud 'de St Liz', wife of William de Albini Brito. He makes her
sixty years old in 1186 (p. 113), and yet widow of Robert fitz
Richard, who died in 1134 (p. 218), finally stating that 'she died in
<i>anno</i> 1140' (<cite>ibid.</cite>)! Here, as in the case of Eudo Dapifer, William's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page360" id="page360"></a>[pg 360]</span>
wife was the daughter, not the widow. In both cases the lady was a
Clare. The fact is certain from his own authority, the cartularies of
St Neot's.<a id="footnotetagwt8" name="footnotetagwt8"></a><a href="#footnotewt8"><sup>8</sup></a>
We have a grant that 'Rob[ertus] filius Ric[ardi]', at
fo. 79<i>b</i>, grants from 'Matildis de Sancto Licio (<i>al.</i> "Senliz") filia
Roberti filii Ricardi' on the same folio, and on the preceding one
(fo. 79) this conclusive one as to her husband:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Ego Willelmus de Albineio Brito et Matild' uxor mea dedimus et concessimus
ecclesiam de Cratefeld deo et ecclesie Sci. Neoti et monachis
Beccensibus pro anima Roberti filii Ricardi et antecessorum meorum.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Then follows their son's confirmation, as 'Willelmus de Albeneio
filius Matillidis de Seint Liz'. Next, 'Willelmus de Albeneio filius
Matild' de Senliz', gives land, 'quam terram Domina Matild' Senliz
mater mea eis prius concesserat'&mdash;her said grant of land in Cratfield
duly following as from 'Matild de Senliz filia Roberti filii Ricardi'.
Further, we have Walter fitz Robert (fitz Richard) confirming this
grant by his sister Matildis. Finally, we learn that Cratfield belonged
to her in 'maritagio'. Now (as 'Cratafelda') it belonged in Domesday
to Ralf Baignard. His honour, on his forfeiture, was given to Robert
fitz Richard, who was thus able to give Cratfield 'in maritagio' to his
daughter. Here then is independent proof of what her parentage
really was, and further independent proof, if needed, is found in this
entry (1185):</p>

<blockquote><p>
Matillis de Sainliz que fuit filia Roberti filii Richardi, et mater Willelmi
de Albeneio est de donatione Domini Regis et est lx. annorum (<cite>Rot. de
Dominabus</cite>, p. 1).
</p></blockquote>

<p>We thus learn that, as with Avicia 'de Rumilly', daughter of William
Meschin, it was possible for a woman to bear, strange though it
may seem, the maiden name of her mother. Clearly, Maud was the
widow of William de Albini, who sent in his <cite>carta</cite> (under Leicestershire)
in 1166, and died, as I reckon, from the Pipe Rolls, in November
1167. She was not, as alleged, the widow of the William who
fought at the Battle of Tinchebrai in 1106.</p>

<p>Lastly, we come to the parentage of Walter Tirel himself. Mr
Freeman wrote that this was 'undoubted', that 'Walter was one of a
family of ten, seemingly the youngest of eight sons' of Fulc, Dean of
Evreux, and that 'he became, by whatever means, Lord of Poix in
Ponthieu and of Ach&egrave;res by the Seine' (<cite>W. Rufus</cite>, II, 322, 673).<a id="footnotetagwt9" name="footnotetagwt9"></a><a href="#footnotewt9"><sup>9</sup></a>
But the mystery of his rise is not lessened by the fact that, as Mr Freeman
put it, most accounts 'connect him with France rather than with
Normandy'. Closer investigation suggests that Orderic in no way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page361" id="page361"></a>[pg 361]</span>
identifies the Walter Tirel of 1100 with the son of Dean Fulc, and
shows indeed that his French editors had specially declared the two
to be distinct. In short, Walter had nothing to do with Dean Fulc or
with Normandy, but was, as categorically stated, a Frenchman, the
third of his name who occurs as Lord of Poix. P&egrave;re Anselme identifies
him with the second (who occurs in 1069), but he is probably identical
with the third, who occurs in an agreement with the Count of
Amiens, 1087, and who, with his wife 'Adelice', founded the Priory
of St Denis de Poix,<a id="footnotetagwt10" name="footnotetagwt10"></a><a href="#footnotewt10"><sup>10</sup></a>
and built the Abbey of St Pierre de S&eacute;lincourt.
It was he who was father of Hugh the Crusader.<a id="footnotetagwt11" name="footnotetagwt11"></a><a href="#footnotewt11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p>Here may be mentioned another name by which Walter seems to
have been known. I take it from the twelfth century chronicle of
Abbot Simon in the 'Chartularium Sithiense',<a id="footnotetagwt12" name="footnotetagwt12"></a><a href="#footnotewt12"><sup>12</sup></a>
which appears to have eluded Mr Freeman's researches when he made his collection
of all the versions of the death of William Rufus:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Willelmus prioris Willelmi regis Angli&aelig; filius, eodem anno a Waltero <em>de
Bekam</em>, ex improviso, interficitur. Qui, cum rege in saltu venatum iens, dum
sagitta cervum appeteret, eadem divinitus retorta, rex occiditur. Cujus
interitus sancte recordationis viro Hugoni, abbati Cluniacensi est pr&aelig;ostensus,
etc., etc.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The testimony of a St Omer writer on the deed of the Lord of Poix is,
even if traditionary, worth noting; but I do not profess to explain
the 'Bekam'.<a id="footnotetagwt13" name="footnotetagwt13"></a><a href="#footnotewt13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>If we now turn to the French writers, we find that the special
work on the family is that of M. Cuvillier-Morel-d'Acy, 'Archiviste-G&eacute;n&eacute;alogiste'.<a id="footnotetagwt14" name="footnotetagwt14"></a><a href="#footnotewt14"><sup>14</sup></a>
It savours, however, of Peerage rather than of
History, and relies for its expansion of P&egrave;re Anselme's somewhat
jejune narrative<a id="footnotetagwt15" name="footnotetagwt15"></a><a href="#footnotewt15"><sup>15</sup></a>
on private MS. collections instead of original
authorities. This work was followed by an elaborate monograph on
'Poix et ses Seigneurs' by M. l'Abb&eacute; Delgove,<a id="footnotetagwt16" name="footnotetagwt16"></a><a href="#footnotewt16"><sup>16</sup></a>
who accepts the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page362" id="page362"></a>[pg 362]</span>
former writer's genealogy without question, though dealing more
critically with the charters of foundation for the Priory of St Denis
de Poix. He admits that these charters are not authentic in their
present form, but accepts their contents as genuine. Now the endowment
of St Denis, according to them, included two marcs out of the
tithes 'de Lavingaham en Angleterre'. Here, though these writers
knew it not, we have again our Essex Langham, the 'Lawingeham'
of the Pipe-Roll. Is this the reason why Walter required the consent
of his wife 'Adeline' and son Hugh to the grant?</p>

<p>Neither of these writers knew of the English evidence, nor did
they solve the mystery of Walter Tirel's wife, whom they, like
Lappenberg, imagined to be the daughter of a Richard Giffard.
This tends to diminish our trust in the pedigree they give. They took
a Walter Tirel to England at the Conquest, but only because Wace
mentions the 'Pohiers', or men of Poix, and because the name of
Tirel is found in the Battle Roll. In their view, Hugh Tirel, Lord of
Poix, the crusader of 1147, was grandson of the famous Walter.
Now Orderic, whose evidence on the point they ignore, says, as we
have seen, he was the son; and as the chronicler was contemporary
both with father and son, we cannot think him mistaken. Moreover,
the Pipe-Roll of 1130 cannot be harmonized with their pedigree.
Adeliz, wife (? widow) of Walter Tirel, then answered for Langham,
and could not be 'Adeline dame de Ribecourt', who was dead,
according to both writers, before 1128 (or 1127), and who could
not, in any case, have aught to do with Langham.</p>

<p>But there is other evidence, unknown to these French writers,
which proves that the version they give must be utterly wrong.
Among the archives at Evreux there is a charter of Hugh Tirel to
the Abbey of Bec, granting 'decem marcas argenti in manerio quod
dicitur Lavigaham' to its daughter-house of Conflans, where, he
says, his mother had taken the religious 'habit', and retired to die.
The Priors of Conflans, and [St Denis of] Poix are among the witnesses;
and we read of the charter's date:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Hoc concessum est apud piceium castrum anno M.cxxxviii. ab incarnatione
dominica viii. idus martii.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Even if we make this date to be 1139, we here find Hugh in possession
of Poix and Langham at that date, whereas the French writers
tell us that he only succeeded in 1145, and that his father died in
that year.<a id="footnotetagwt17" name="footnotetagwt17"></a><a href="#footnotewt17"><sup>17</sup></a>
The above charter, moreover, points to his mother having
survived his father, and died at Conflans as a widow. Until,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page363" id="page363"></a>[pg 363]</span>
therefore, evidence is produced in support of the French version, we
must reject it <i>in toto</i>.</p>

<p>I close this study with an extract from that interesting charter by
which Richard I empowered Henry de Cornhill to enclose and impark
his woods at Langham, the same day (December 6, 1189) on
which he empowered his neighbours the burgesses of Colchester to
hunt the fox, the hare and the 'cat' within their borders. The words
are:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Sciatis nos dedisse et concessisse Henrico de Cornhell' licentiam includendi
boscum suum in Lahingeham et faciendi sibi ibidem parcum, et ut liceat illi
habere omnes bestias quos poterit ibi includere.<a id="footnotetagwt18" name="footnotetagwt18"></a><a href="#footnotewt18"><sup>18</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus did the wealthy Londoner become a country squire seven
centuries ago. Nor is it irrelevant to observe that the 'Langham
Lodge coverts' are familiar to this day to those who hunt with the
Essex and Suffolk.</p>

<h3>WALDRIC, WARRIOR AND CHANCELLOR</h3><!-- wwc -->

<p>The importance of fixing the sequence of chancellors, for chronological
purposes and especially the dating of charters, is very great.
Waldric, who preceded Ranulf as chancellor to Henry I, was, as a
warrior and then a bishop, a man of mark. It has hitherto been supposed,
as by Mr Archer (who wrote his life for the <cite>Dictionary of
National Biography</cite>), that his latest appearance as chancellor was
early in 1106, before the King's departure for Normandy. His feat in
taking Duke Robert prisoner at Tinchebrai (September 28, 1106)
is well known, but was believed to be the only evidence of his
presence in Normandy with the King. There is, however, in <cite>Gallia
Christiana</cite> (vol. xi) a valuable charter recording a 'causa seu placitum',
decided before King Henry at Rouen, November 7, 1106,
among those present being 'Waldricus qui tunc temporis erat regis
cancellarius'. We can trace, therefore, his tenure of the office up to
that date.</p>

<p>There is some doubt and difficulty as to another charter. Foss
believed that Waldric was the 'Walterus Cancellarius' who is found
in a charter to Tewkesbury of '1106'.<a id="footnotetagwwc1" name="footnotetagwwc1"></a><a href="#footnotewwc1"><sup>1</sup></a>
This charter is printed in
the <cite>Monasticon</cite> (ii. 66) from an Inspeximus <i>temp.</i> Henry IV. There is,
however, a better Inspeximus on the Charter Roll of 28 Edward I<a id="footnotetagwwc2" name="footnotetagwwc2"></a><a href="#footnotewwc2"><sup>2</sup></a>
(No. 16), in which the name is clearly Waldric. But the difficulty is
that the same Inspeximus contains another version of this charter
(No. 2), with a fuller list of witnesses.<a id="footnotetagwwc3" name="footnotetagwwc3"></a><a href="#footnotewwc3"><sup>3</sup></a>
I have examined the roll for
myself, and there is no doubt as to the date, for the clause runs:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Facta est hec carta Anno.... ab incarnacione domini M<sup>o</sup> centesimo vii<sup>o</sup>
apud Wintoniam.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The other version, in the body of the charter, contains the words,
'Anno Dominic&aelig; Incarnationis millesimo centesimo sexto apud
Wintoniam'. I have always looked with some suspicion on these
Tewkesbury charters,<a id="footnotetagwwc4" name="footnotetagwwc4"></a><a href="#footnotewwc4"><sup>4</sup></a> and that suspicion is not lessened by the
double version of this, or by the name of the last witness in that of
1107, namely, 'Roger de Pistres'. The only known bearer of that
name was dead before Domesday, though this witness may just
possibly be identical with Roger de Gloucester (son, I hold, of
Durand de Pistres<a id="footnotetagwwc5" name="footnotetagwwc5"></a><a href="#footnotewwc5"><sup>5</sup></a>) who was killed in 1106.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page365" id="page365"></a>[pg 365]</span></p>

<p>On the whole, it is safer to deem that Waldric's last appearance as
chancellor, at present known, is in the Rouen charter of November
1106. Ranulf, his successor, first appears as Foss pointed out,<a id="footnotetagwwc6" name="footnotetagwwc6"></a><a href="#footnotewwc6"><sup>6</sup></a>
in a charter to St Andrew's Priory, Northampton.<a id="footnotetagwwc7" name="footnotetagwwc7"></a><a href="#footnotewwc7"><sup>7</sup></a> Its date is
determined by the appearance among the witnesses of Maurice,
Bishop of London (d. September 26, 1107) and of Ranulf himself
as chancellor, combined with the statement appended to the
charter that it was granted in the King's eighth year ('octavo
imperii sui anno'). One must not attach too great importance to
these clauses, which did not, as a rule, form part of the original
charter, but in this case the names of the witnesses point to Easter&mdash;September
1107; and it is just possible to assign to the eighth year
the close of the Westminster gathering, at the beginning of August,
when this charter to St Andrew's may well have been granted.</p>

<p>Miss Norgate holds that Bishop Roger 'probably resumed' the

<h3>A CHARTER OF HENRY I (1123)</h3><!-- chi -->

<p>A good illustration of the value of charters for chronological and
biographical purposes is afforded by one which Henry I granted to
the church of Exeter. It is printed in the <cite>Monasticon</cite> under Plimpton,
to the foundation of which priory it is asserted to have been preliminary.
That foundation is assigned to 1121. The charter, however,
is also found among those confirmed by Henry VIII (Confirmation
Roll, <span class="sc">i</span> Henry VIII, p. 5, No. 13), with a list of witnesses arranged
in correct order; whereas the <cite>Monasticon</cite> version is taken from the
pleadings under Richard II (Coram Rege, Hil. 2 Richard II,
Rot. 20, Devon), and records the witnesses in grievous disorder.
The explanation of such disorder is that the clerk in the latter case
was not familiar with the system on which the attestations to these
charters were arranged, the names of the leading witnesses being
placed in a line above the others. This will be made evident from
the two lists of witnesses:</p>

<p>It is obvious that this charter was granted before the death of the
Bishop of Worcester (October 20, 1123), and before the King's
departure from England (June 1123). But it must be subsequent to
the death of the previous chancellor, Ranulf (Christmas 1122),
and to the appointment or consecration (February 1123) of Archbishop
William. The narrow limit thus ascertained points to the
Easter court of 1123 at Winchester, the great gathering of bishops
and earls implying some such occasion. Easter fell that year on
April 15th.</p>

<p>Now two sees had fallen vacant at the beginning of the year,
those of Lincoln and of Bath. Lincoln was given to Alexander,
whether at Easter (Winchester), as stated by Henry of Huntingdon,
or in Lent, as asserted by the continuator of Florence; but he was
not consecrated till July 22nd. Bath was bestowed on Godfrey,
whose consecration did not take place till August 26th, though
Henry of Huntingdon assigns his appointment, like that of Alexander,
to Easter (Winchester). Both these bishops, it will be seen, attest the
above charter, which proves that it cannot be earlier than Easter
(April 15th), while the evidence below practically limits it to the
Easter court at Winchester.</p>

<p>The first point to be observed is that these two bishops attest as
such (not as 'elect') long before their consecration. As it is generally
held that bishops never did so, this point is of importance (always
assuming the accuracy of the evidence) for its bearing on other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page368" id="page368"></a>[pg 368]</span>
charters.<a id="footnotetagchi2" name="footnotetagchi2"></a><a href="#footnotechi2"><sup>2</sup></a>
Secondly, four of the witnesses&mdash;the two archbishops, the
Bishop of St David's, and the Abbot of Glastonbury&mdash;are said by
the continuator to have left for Rome after Alexander's appointment.
From this charter it is clear that they did not leave till after Easter.
The third point is that Earl Roger of Warwick had, at the date of
this charter, succeeded his father, Henry.</p>

<p>Turning to Geoffrey the chancellor, we find in this charter perhaps
his earliest appearance. Foss, in his useful work, is here a year
out. He wrongly assigned the death of the preceding chancellor,
Ranulf, to Christmas 1123, instead of Christmas 1122, and he
assumed that our charter must be subsequent to Bishop Godfrey's
consecration (August 26, 1123), and, in fact, that it belonged to
1124 (to which year he wrongly assigned the death of Bishop Theowulf).
It is important for chronological purposes to date the change
of chancellor correctly. I have already determined (p. <a href="#page365">365</a>) the date <!-- 481=365 -->
of Ranulf's accession to the post.</p>

<p>The correction of this date of Ranulf's death affects that of the
foundation of Laund Priory, Leicestershire, which is assigned by
Nichols and by the Editors of the <cite>Monasticon</cite> to 'about 1125'. As
the foundation charter is addressed to William, Archbishop of
Canterbury, and Alexander, Bishop of Lincoln, it must be subsequent
to Alexander's promotion in the spring of 1123 (if not to his
consecration on June 22nd). This is admitted by Foss, who accepts
the charter without question. There is nothing in the document to
excite suspicion, nor do I impugn it without reluctance. But the
awkward fact remains that it is witnessed by Ranulf the chancellor,
who died, as we have seen, at the beginning of 1123, and actually in
the lifetime of Bishop Robert, Alexander's predecessor at Lincoln.
There can be no question as to Ranulf's death, for the sequence of
events is inexorable. Henry of Huntingdon tells us that (1) the
king spent Christmas (1122) at Dunstable; that (2) he went thence
to Berkhampstead, where Ranulf was accidentally killed; that
(3) he then visited Woodstock, where Bishop Robert met with an
equally sudden death; that (4) at the Purification (February 2,
1123) he gave the See of Canterbury to William of Corbeuil;
that (5) he gave (at Winchester) the See of Lincoln to Alexander
at Easter. It is singular that the members of the foundation had two
strings to their bow, another charter of Henry I being adduced for
Inspeximus. Its witnesses imply a later date, and their names do not
involve any chronological difficulty.</p>

<p>We have in this Exeter charter one of the earliest attestations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page369" id="page369"></a>[pg 369]</span>
(according to my theory) of Robert as Earl of Gloucester. It should
be noted that he takes at once precedence of all other earls, just as
he had taken, before his elevation, precedence of all laymen under
the rank of earl.</p>

<p>Of the barons most are familiar. Richard fitz Baldwin was the
son and successor of the famous Baldwin of Exeter, and was, like
him, sheriff of Devon (see p. <a href="#page236">236</a><sup>239</sup>).
Baldwin de Redvers was the son
of Richard de Redvers, and became subsequently first earl of Devon
(the confusion of these two families, from the similarity of name, seems
to be incorrigible).<a id="footnotetagchi3" name="footnotetagchi3"></a><a href="#footnotechi3"><sup>3</sup></a>
The lords of the great honours of Barnstaple and
Totnes<a id="footnotetagchi4" name="footnotetagchi4"></a><a href="#footnotechi4"><sup>4</sup></a>
are followed by Robert of Bampton, who had succeeded
to the Domesday fief of Walter de Douai, and who, as I have shown
(<cite>English Historical Review</cite>, v. 746), was afterwards a rebel against
Stephen. Goislin de Pomerey was the heir of Ralf de Pomerey, the
Domesday baron; and Reginald (Rainaldus) de Vautort was a great
under-tenant of the honour of Mortain. William fitz Richard I
identify with that great Cornish magnate, whose daughter and
heiress carried his fief to Reginald, afterwards Earl of Cornwall.
Herbert de Alneto also was a Cornish baron, father of that Richard
who, in 1130, paid &pound;100 for his succession (<cite>Rot. Pip.</cite>, 31 Henry I,
p. 158). Specially interesting, however, is the name of William fitz
Odo, in whom I detect not the William fitz <em>Otho</em>, of Essex and
Middlesex (with whom he is confused in the Index to the 1130
Pipe-Roll), but the son of 'Odo filius Gamelin'; a Devonshire tenant-in-chief
(D.B., i. 116<i>b</i>). I see him in that '&mdash;filius Odonis', who is
entered on the damaged Devonshire roll (<cite>Rot. Pip.</cite>, 31 Henry I,
p. 157) in connection with thirty-four shillings, which proves that he
held a considerable estate. The fief of 'Odo filius Gamelin' was
assessed at 21-3/16 hides, representing in Devon large estates.<a id="footnotetagchi5" name="footnotetagchi5"></a><a href="#footnotechi5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p class="footnote1"><a id="footnotechi1" name="footnotechi1"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotetagchi1"><sup>1</sup></a>
It will be observed that this list omits the Bishops of London and Winchester
and the Earls of Huntingdon and Chester, but adds the Abbot of Cerne.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="footnotechi2" name="footnotechi2"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotetagchi2"><sup>2</sup></a>
An excellent instance of this practice is found, ten years later, in the case of
Bishop Nigel, who attested three charters in 1133, before the king's departure,
as Bishop of Ely, though he was not consecrated till some months later. They are
those found in <cite>Monasticon</cite>, vi. 1174, 1274, and that which granted the chamberlainship
to Aubrey de Vere.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="footnotechi3" name="footnotechi3"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotetagchi3"><sup>3</sup></a>
It has found its way, under 'Baldwin', into the <cite>Dictionary of National Biography</cite>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="footnotechi4" name="footnotechi4"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotetagchi4"><sup>4</sup></a>
The <em>Guido de Totteneys</em> of this charter seems to be identical with the <em>Wido de
Nunant</em> of the charter granted by Henry II to this priory. This conjecture is confirmed
by the entry in the Pipe-Roll of 31 Hen. I: 'Wido de Nunant reddit comp.
de x. marcis pro concessione ferie de Totneis' (p. 154). There is a story quoted by
Dugdale, under Totnes priory, from the records of the abbey of Angers, that Juhel
'of Totnes', the Domesday baron, was expelled by William Rufus, and his lands
given to Roger de Nunant. I certainly find Roger de Nonant attesting in 1091
the foundation charter of Salisbury Cathedral in conjunction with William fitz
Baldwin (see pp. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Footnote 37"><a href="#page256">256</a></ins>, <a href="#page358">358</a>); and Manors belonging to Juhel in 1086 are found<!-- see -->   <!-- [330=p. 256, footnote 37][472=p. 358] -->
afterwards belonging to Valletort, Nonant's successor, as part of his honour of
Totnes. But it would seem that Juhel retained part of his honour of Barnstaple,
while the Nonants held the rest as the honour of Totnes. Indeed, he must have
held both <i>capita</i> so late as 1113, when, say the monks of Laon, 'venimus ad castrum,
quod dicitur Bannistaplum, ubi manebat quidam princeps nomine Joellus de
Totenes', etc. (<i>Hermannus</i>, ii. 17), adding that they afterwards visited Totnes
'pr&aelig;fati principis castrum' (<cite>ibid.</cite>, 18).</p>

<h3>THE ORIGIN OF THE NEVILLES</h3><!-- on -->

<p>It is difficult to believe that so interesting a genealogical question
as the origin of this famous house should have remained as yet
undetermined. I have shown above (p. 137) that we can identify
in Domesday Gilbert and Ralph de Neville, the earliest bearers of
the name in England, as knightly tenants of the Abbot of Peterborough;
but the existing house, as is well known, descends from
them only through a female. It is at its origin in the male line that
I here glance. The innumerable quarters in which, unfortunately,
information of this kind has been published makes it impossible for
me to say whether I have been forestalled. So far, however, as I
can find at present, two different versions are in the field.</p>

<p>First, there is Dugdale's view that Robert fitz Maldred, their
founder, was 'son of Dolfin, son of Earl Gospatric, son of Maldred
fitz Crinan by Algitha daughter of Uchtred, Earl of Northumberland,
who was son-in-law to King &AElig;thelred'. This was, apparently,
Mr Shirley's view, for, in his <cite>Noble and Gentle Men of England</cite> he
derives the Nevilles from 'Gospatric, the Saxon Earl of Northumberland',
though he makes Robert fitz Maldred his <em>great</em>-grandson, as
Rowland had done in his work on the House of Nevill (1830), by
placing Maldred between Dolfin and Robert fitz Maldred. Even
that sceptical genealogist, Mr Foster, admitted in his peerage their
descent from this Earl Gospatric. The immediate ancestry, however,
of their founder, Robert fitz Maldred, can be proved, and is as
follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 285px"><img src="images/370-285.png" width="285" height="355" alt="Family tree" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page371" id="page371"></a>[pg 371]</span></p>

<p>Drummond's <cite>Noble British Families</cite> (1842) set out a new origin for
the family without any hesitation, and this was adopted by the
Duchess of Cleveland, whose elaborate work on the <cite>Battle Abbey
Roll</cite> has much excellent genealogy. Their patriarch Dolfin was now
made the son of that Uchtred, who was a grandson and namesake
of Dugdale's Earl Uchtred, <i>temp.</i> King &AElig;thelred. A chart
pedigree is required to show the descent of the earls:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px"><img src="images/371-500.png" width="500" height="330" alt="Family tree" /></div>

<p>No authority, unfortunately, is given for the identity of this Uchtred
with Uchtred, father of Dolfin, and the assumption of that identity
involves the conclusion that Eadwulf 'Rus', who took the lead in the
murder of Bishop Walcher (1080), was brother to Dolfin who received
Staindrop in 1131, and uncle to a man who died in 1195 or 1196!
We cannot therefore accept this descent as it stands, or carry the
pedigree at present beyond Dolfin fitz Uchtred (1131). But as this
Dolfin, when doing homage to the Prior of Durham for Staindrop,
reserved his homage to the kings of England and of Scotland, as
well as the Bishop of Durham, he was, no doubt, a man of consequence,
and was probably of high Northumbrian birth. It may be
worth throwing out, as a hint, the suggestion that his father Uchtred
might have been identical with Uchtred, son of Ligulf, that great
Northumbrian thegn who was slain at Durham in 1080. But this is
only a guess. One cannot, in fact, be too careful, as I have shown in
my two papers on 'Odard of Carlisle' and 'Odard the Sheriff',<a id="footnotetagon1" name="footnotetagon1"></a><a href="#footnoteon1"><sup>1</sup></a>
in identifying two individuals of the same Christian names, when, in
these northern districts, the names in question were so widely borne.
The Whitby cartulary, for instance, proves that Thomas de Hastings
was (maternal) grandson of Alan, son of Thorphin 'de Alverstain',
son of Uchtred (son of Gospatric), which Uchtred gave the Church
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page372" id="page372"></a>[pg 372]</span>
of Crosby Ravensworth to the abbey in the time, it would seem, of
William Rufus. But who Gospatric, his father, was has not been
clearly ascertained. The skilled genealogists of the north may be able
to decide these points, and to tell us the true descent of 'Dolfin, the
son of Uchtred'.</p>

<h3>THE ALLEGED INVASION OF ENGLAND IN 1147</h3><!-- ai -->

<p>When Mr Richard Howlett, in the preface to his edition of the
<cite>Gesta Stephani</cite> for the Rolls series, announced that we were indebted
to its 'careful author' for the knowledge of an invasion of England
by Henry FitzEmpress in 1147, 'unrecorded by any other chronicler',
and endeavoured at considerable length to establish this proposition,<a id="footnotetagai1" name="footnotetagai1"></a><a href="#footnoteai1"><sup>1</sup></a>
it was received, from all that I can learn, with general incredulity.
As, however, in the volume which he has since edited, he reiterates his
belief in this alleged invasion,<a id="footnotetagai2" name="footnotetagai2"></a><a href="#footnoteai2"><sup>2</sup></a>
it becomes necessary to examine in
detail the evidence for a discovery so authoritatively announced
in the pages of the Rolls series.</p>

<p>The accepted view of Henry's movements has hitherto been that,
by his father's permission, in the autumn of 1142 he accompanied the
Earl of Gloucester to England; that he remained there about four
years; that, by his father's wish, at the end of 1146 or beginning of
1147 he returned from England; that he then spent two years and
four months over sea; that in the spring of 1149 he again came to
England, and was knighted at Carlisle by the king of Scots on May
22nd. As to the above long visit, commencing in 1142, Gervase of
Canterbury is our chief authority, but the other chroniclers (omitting
for the present the <cite>Gesta Stephani</cite>) harmonize well with his account.
Gervase and Robert of Torigni alike mention but one arrival of
Henry (1142) and one departure (1146 or 1147), thus distinctly
implying there was then only one visit&mdash;namely, that visit which
Gervase tells us lasted four years. The only slight discrepancy
between Gervase and Robert is found in the date of Henry's departure.
Robert places that event under 1147, and mentions that Henry
visited Bec May 29th in that year. There is also, Mr Howlett has
pointed out, charter evidence implying that Henry was back in
Normandy in March or April. Now Gervase says distinctly that he
was away from England two years and four months. The chroniclers,
Gervase included, say that he returned to England in the middle of
May 1149. Counting back the two years and four months, this would
bring us to January 1147, as the date of his departure from England.
But there is a charter of his to Salisbury Cathedral, tested, as Mr
Howlett observes, at Devizes, April 13, 1149. If this evidence be
trustworthy, it would take us back to December 1146, instead of
January 1147. It is easy to see how Gervase may have included in
1146, and Robert in 1147, an event which appears to have taken
place about the end of the one or the beginning of the other year.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page374" id="page374"></a>[pg 374]</span></p>

<p>Much has been made of the alleged circumstance that Gervase
assigned the Earl of Gloucester's death to 1146, whereas he is known
to have died in 1147. But reference to his text will show that he
does nothing of the kind. Writing of Henry's departure at the close
of 1146, he tells us that the earl was destined never to see him again,
for he died in November [<i>i.e.</i> November 1147]. He is here obviously
anticipating.</p>

<p>Such being the evidence on which is based the accepted view of
Henry's movements, let us now turn to the <cite>Gesta Stephani</cite>. Though
Mr Howlett's knowledge of the period is great and quite exceptional,
I cannot but think that he has been led astray by his admiration for
this fascinating chronicle. Miss Norgate sensibly observes that 'there
must be something wrong in the story' as actually preserved in the
<cite>Gesta</cite>,<a id="footnotetagai3" name="footnotetagai3"></a><a href="#footnoteai3"><sup>3</sup></a>
but Mr Howlett, unwilling to admit the possibility of error
in his chronicle, boldly asserts that the 'romantic account'<a id="footnotetagai4" name="footnotetagai4"></a><a href="#footnoteai4"><sup>4</sup></a>
of Henry's adventures which it contains does not refer to his visit in 1149, but to
a hitherto unknown invasion in 1147. He appears to imagine that the
only objection in accepting this story is found in the fact that Henry
was but just fourteen at the time.<a id="footnotetagai5" name="footnotetagai5"></a><a href="#footnoteai5"><sup>5</sup></a>
But this is not so. Putting aside
this objection, as also the silence of other chroniclers, there remains
the chronological difficulty. How is the alleged visit to be fitted in?
Its inventor, who suggests 'about April 1147', for its date, must first
take Henry back to Normandy (why or when he does not even
suggest) and then bring him back to England as an invader, neither
his alleged going or coming being recorded by any chronicler. Then
he assigns to his second return to Normandy (after the alleged invasion)
the only passages in Gervase and Robert which speak of his
returning at all. Surely nothing could be more improbable than
that Henry should rush back to England just after he had left it,
and had returned to his victorious father, and this at a time when his
cause seemed as hopeless there as it was prosperous over the sea.</p>

<p>The evidence of the <cite>Gesta Stephani</cite> would have, indeed, to be
beyond question if we are to accept, on its sole authority, so improbable
a story. But what does that evidence amount to? The
<cite>Gesta</cite>, unlike other chronicles, not being arranged chronologically
under years, the only definite note of time here afforded in its text
is found in the passage, 'Consuluit [Henricus] et avunculum [<i>sic</i>]
Glaorni&aelig; comitem, sed ipse suis sacculis avide incumbens, rebus
tantum sibi necessariis occurrere maluit'.<a id="footnotetagai6" name="footnotetagai6"></a><a href="#footnoteai6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>As Earl Robert is known to have died in the autumn of 1147,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page375" id="page375"></a>[pg 375]</span>
the word <i>avunculus</i> does, undoubtedly, fix these events as prior to
that date. But is not <i>avunculus</i> a slip of the writer for <i>cognatus</i>? Is not
the reference to Earl William rather than to his father, Earl
Robert?<a id="footnotetagai7" name="footnotetagai7"></a><a href="#footnoteai7"><sup>7</sup></a>
Such a slip is no mere conjecture; the statement that Earl
Robert was too avaricious to assist his beloved nephew in his hour
of need is not only absolutely contrary to all that we know of his
character, but is virtually discredited by the <cite>Gesta</cite> itself when its
author tells us, further on:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Comes deinde Glaorni&aelig; ut erat regis adversariorum strenuissimus et ad
magna quevis struenda paratissimus, iterum atque iterum exercitum comparare,
jugi hortaminis et admonitionis stimulo complices suos incitavit;
illos minis, istos promissis sibi et pr&aelig;miis conjugare; quatinus omnes in unam
concordiam, in unum animum conspirati, exercitum e diverso ad idem velle
repararent, et collectis undecumque agminibus, vive et constanter in regem
insurgerent.<a id="footnotetagai8" name="footnotetagai8"></a><a href="#footnoteai8"><sup>8</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>How can such language as this be reconciled with the statement
as to Earl Robert's apathy at the very time when Henry's efforts
offered him a unique opportunity of pursuing his war against the
king? Mr Howlett does not attempt to meet, or even notice, this
objection. Moreover, when the <cite>Gesta</cite> proceeds to describe Earl
William of Gloucester as devoted to his own pleasures rather than to
war,<a id="footnotetagai9" name="footnotetagai9"></a><a href="#footnoteai9"><sup>9</sup></a>
we see that the conduct so incredible in his father would in
him be what we might expect.</p>

<p>I will not follow Mr Howlett in his lengthy argument relative to
the knighting of Eustace and Henry, because he himself admits that
it is based only on conjecture.<a id="footnotetagai10" name="footnotetagai10"></a><a href="#footnoteai10"><sup>10</sup></a>
It is sufficient to observe that if the
'romantic' narrative in the <cite>Gesta</cite> refers to the events of 1149,<a id="footnotetagai11" name="footnotetagai11"></a><a href="#footnoteai11"><sup>11</sup></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page376" id="page376"></a>[pg 376]</span>
then the knighting of Eustace, which is a pendant to that narrative,
belongs, as the other chroniclers assert, to 1149. The statement, I
may add, that Henry applied for help to his mother, by no means
involves, as Mr Howlett assumes, her presence in England at the
time.</p>

<p>I would suggest, then, that the whole hypothesis of this invasion
in 1147 is based on nothing more than a confusion in the <cite>Gesta</cite>.
Mr Howlett, indeed, claims that 'mediaeval history would simply
disappear if the evidence of chroniclers were to be treated in this
way,<a id="footnotetagai12" name="footnotetagai12"></a><a href="#footnoteai12"><sup>12</sup></a>
and detects 'among some modern writers a tendency to incautious
rejection', etc.<a id="footnotetagai13" name="footnotetagai13"></a><a href="#footnoteai13"><sup>13</sup></a>
But he himself goes out of his way to denounce,
in this connection, as a 'blundering interpolation' a passage
in John of Hexham, which he assigns to notes being 'carelessly misplaced'
and 'ignorantly miscopied'.<a id="footnotetagai14" name="footnotetagai14"></a><a href="#footnoteai14"><sup>14</sup></a>
The <cite>Gesta</cite>, to my knowledge, is
by no means immaculate; its unbroken narrative and vagueness as
to dates render its chronology a matter of difficulty; and the circumstance
that the passage in dispute occurs towards its close renders
it impossible to test it as we could wish by comparison with later
portions. The weakness of Mr Howlett's case is shown by his desperate
appeal to 'the exact precedent' set by Fulk Nerra, and no talk
about the contrast presented by 'physical science' and that 'fragmentary
tale of human inconsistencies which we term history' can
justify the inclusion of this alleged invasion as a fact beyond dispute
in so formal and authoritative a quarter as the preface to a Rolls
volume.</p>

<h3>THE ALLEGED DEBATE ON DANEGELD (1163)</h3><!-- dd -->

<p>The great importance attached by historians to the financial dispute
at the council of Woodstock in 1163 renders it desirable that the
point at issue should be clearly stated and understood. As I venture
to believe that the accepted view on the matter in dispute is erroneous,
I here submit the reasons which have led me to that conclusion.
'Two most important points,' writes Dr Stubbs, 'stand
out' on this occasion: (1) 'this is the first case of any express opposition
being made to the king's financial dealings since the Conquest';
(2) 'the first fruit of the first constitutional opposition is the abolition
of the most ancient property-tax [danegeld] imposed as a bribe for
the Danes'.<a id="footnotetagdd1" name="footnotetagdd1"></a><a href="#footnotedd1"><sup>1</sup></a>
It is with the second of these points that I propose
especially to deal.</p>

<p>The passage which forms our best evidence is found in Grim's
<cite>Life of St Thomas</cite>, and its relative portion is as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Movetur qu&aelig;stio de consuetudine quadam quae in Anglia tenebatur.
Dabantur de hida bini solidi ministris regis qui vicecomitum loco comitatus
servabant, quos voluit rex conscribere fisco et reditibus propriis associare.
Cui archiepiscopus in faciem restitit, dicens, non debere eos exigi pro reditibus,
'nec pro reditu', inquit, 'dabimus eos, domine rex, salvo beneplacito
vestro: sed si digne nobis servierint vicecomites, et servientes vel ministri
provinciarum, et homines nostros manutenuerint, nequaquam eis deerimus
in auxilium.' Rex autem aegre ferens archiepiscopi responsionem, 'Per
oculos Dei', ait, 'dabuntur pro reditu, et in scriptura regis scribentur'.
</p></blockquote>

<p>On this passage Dr Stubbs thus comments:</p>

<blockquote><p>
A tax so described can hardly have been anything else than the danegeld,
which was an impost of two shillings on the hide, and was collected by the
sheriffs, being possibly compounded for at a certain rate and paid by them
into the exchequer. As the danegeld from this very year 1163 ceases to
appear as a distinct item of account in the Pipe-Rolls, it is impossible to
avoid connecting the two ideas, even if we may not identify them. Whether
the king's object in making this proposition was to collect the danegeld in
full amount, putting an end to the nominal assessment which had so long
been in use, and so depriving the sheriffs of such profits as they made from
it, or whether he had some other end in view, it is impossible now to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page378" id="page378"></a>[pg 378]</span>
determine; and consequently it is difficult to understand the position taken
by the archbishop.<a id="footnotetagdd2" name="footnotetagdd2"></a><a href="#footnotedd2"><sup>2</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>The attempt to identify the payment in dispute with the danegeld
does indeed lead to the greatest possible difficulties, and Miss Norgate,
who follows closely in Dr Stubbs' footsteps, is no more successful
in answering them;<a id="footnotetagdd3" name="footnotetagdd3"></a><a href="#footnotedd3"><sup>3</sup></a>
for, in the first place, the words of Grim do not
apply to the danegeld if taken in their natural sense; and in the
second the proceeds of the danegeld were already royal revenue,
and were duly paid in, as such, at the exchequer. To meet this
latter and obvious difficulty Dr Stubbs suggests that:</p>

<blockquote><p>
as the sums paid into the exchequer under that name (danegeld) were very
small compared with the extent of land that paid the tax, it is probable that
the sheriffs paid a fixed composition and retained the surplus as wages for
their services (etc.).<a id="footnotetagdd4" name="footnotetagdd4"></a><a href="#footnotedd4"><sup>4</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>So, too, Miss Norgate urges that the danegeld 'still occasionally
made its appearance in the treasury rolls, but in such small amount
that it is evident the sheriffs, if they collected it in full, paid only a
fixed composition to the crown, and kept the greater part as a
remuneration for their own services'.<a id="footnotetagdd5" name="footnotetagdd5"></a><a href="#footnotedd5"><sup>5</sup></a>
Now this suggestion raises the
whole question as to the revenue from danegeld. We are told that 'the
danegeld was a very unpopular tax, probably because it was the
plea on which the sheriffs made their greatest profit ... having
become in the long lapse of years a mere composition paid by the
sheriff to the exchequer, while the balance of the whole sums
exacted on that account went to swell his own income'.<a id="footnotetagdd6" name="footnotetagdd6"></a><a href="#footnotedd6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>As against this view I venture to hold that the danegeld was in no
way compounded for, but that every penny raised by its agency was
due to the royal treasury, leaving no profit whatever to the sheriff.
The test is easily applied: let us take the case of Dorset. The Domesday
assessment of this county, according to the late Mr Eyton, who
had investigated it with his usual painstaking labour, and collated it
with the geld-rolls of two years before, was about 2,300 hides.<a id="footnotetagdd7" name="footnotetagdd7"></a><a href="#footnotedd7"><sup>7</sup></a>
This assessment would produce, at two shillings on the hide, about
&pound;230. Now the actual amount accounted for on the Pipe-Roll of
1130 is &pound;228 5s; on that of 1156 it is &pound;228 5s; and on that of 1162, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page379" id="page379"></a>[pg 379]</span>
last levy, it is &pound;247 5s.<a id="footnotetagdd8" name="footnotetagdd8"></a><a href="#footnotedd8"><sup>8</sup></a>
There is certainly no margin of profit for the
sheriff here. In other counties, we find that the proceeds of the
danegeld in 1130, 1156, and 1162, whilst slightly fluctuating,
roughly correspond, as, indeed, they were bound to do, the Domesday
assessment remaining unchanged.<a id="footnotetagdd9" name="footnotetagdd9"></a><a href="#footnotedd9"><sup>9</sup></a>
I can, therefore, find no
ground for the alleged discrepancy between the amounts accounted
for by the sheriffs and those which the assessment ought to have
produced.</p>

<p>This being so, the solitary explanation suggested for Henry's
action falls to the ground, and it becomes clear that the payment in
dispute could not have been the danegeld, as the proposed change
could not increase the amount it produced already. As a matter of
fact, the last occasion on which danegeld <i>eo nomine</i> was levied was in
1162, but to connect that circumstance with the Woodstock dispute
of 1163 is an instance of the <i>post hoc propter hoc</i> argument, more
especially as the danegeld was not in dispute, still less its abolition.
On the contrary, the primate desired to keep things as they were.
What, then, was this mysterious payment but the <i>auxilium vicecomitis</i>,
or 'sheriffs' aid'? Garnier distinctly states that this is what it was,<a id="footnotetagdd10" name="footnotetagdd10"></a><a href="#footnotedd10"><sup>10</sup></a>
and Grim's words no less unmistakably point to the same conclusion.
To institutional students of the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries the <i>auxilium vicecomitis</i> is familiar enough. It was, writes
Dr Stubbs, a 'payment made to the sheriff for his services',<a id="footnotetagdd11" name="footnotetagdd11"></a><a href="#footnotedd11"><sup>11</sup></a>
and was, it may be added, a customary charge, varying in amount,<a id="footnotetagdd12" name="footnotetagdd12"></a><a href="#footnotedd12"><sup>12</sup></a>
paid over locally to the sheriffs. It may fairly be said to have stood to the
danegeld in the relation of rates to taxes.</p>

<p>On this hypothesis the difficulties of the case vanish at once, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page380" id="page380"></a>[pg 380]</span>
Henry's object is made plain. To add this regular annual levy to
his own revenues would be all clear gain, and would relieve him
<i>pro tanto</i> from the necessity of spasmodic and irregular taxation.
As for the sheriffs and the districts beneath their sway, they were
possibly to be left to their own devices to find a substitute for the lost
'aid', like a modern county council bereft of its wheel tax; for the
thought suggests itself that Henry was attempting to reverse the
process that we have lately witnessed, by relieving the taxes at the
expense of the rates, instead of the rates at the expense of the taxes.
Whether, therefore, the attitude of the primate can be described as
'opposition to the king's will in the matter of taxation' is perhaps
just open to question. He took his stand on the sure ground of
existing 'custom', recognized at that time as binding on all.<a id="footnotetagdd13" name="footnotetagdd13"></a><a href="#footnotedd13"><sup>13</sup></a>
One is tempted to discern a grim irony in Henry's action when he
promptly proceeded to turn the tables on his old friend by appealing
to the <i>avit&aelig; consuetudines</i> as obviously binding on so rigid a constitutional
purist as the primate.<a id="footnotetagdd14" name="footnotetagdd14"></a><a href="#footnotedd14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

for the first time in English history since the Norman Conquest the right of the
nation's representatives to oppose the financial demands of the crown was asserted
in the Council of Woodstock, and asserted with such success that the king was
obliged not merely to abandon his project, but to obliterate the last trace of the
tradition on which it was founded' (<cite>Angevin Kings</cite>, ii. 16).</p>

his position by making him repudiate his undoubted obligation.</p>

<h3>A GLIMPSE OF THE YOUNG KING'S COURT (1170)</h3><!-- yk -->

<p>The charter given below is cited by Madox as evidence that in the
days of Henry II the exchequer was still 'sometimes holden in other
places' than Westminster. Contrary to his usual practice, he does
not print the charter; so, wishing to ascertain what light it might
throw on the private transaction it records, I referred to its original
enrolment.<a id="footnotetagyk1" name="footnotetagyk1"></a><a href="#footnoteyk1"><sup>1</sup></a>
Finding that its evidence would prove of some historical
value, I decided to edit it for the use of students.<a id="footnotetagyk2" name="footnotetagyk2"></a><a href="#footnoteyk2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>The purpose of the charter is soon disposed of; it records a grant by
the Earl of Essex to Roger fitz Richard (who had married the earl's
aunt 'Alice of Essex'<a id="footnotetagyk5" name="footnotetagyk5"></a><a href="#footnoteyk5"><sup>5</sup></a>)
of Aynho, Northants, in exchange for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page382" id="page382"></a>[pg 382]</span>
Compton, co. Warwick. Both Manors were in the Mandeville fief,
and the former was to be held, as the latter had been (in 1166<a id="footnotetagyk6" name="footnotetagyk6"></a><a href="#footnoteyk6"><sup>6</sup></a>),
'per servicium unius militis et dimidii'.</p>

<p>The interest of the document is to be sought in its witnesses, and
its place of testing, and above all in the date which, I hope to show,
they suggest. The mention of the two inseparable archdeacons proves
that this date cannot be later than 1174, and consequently, as the
young king was present, must have been previous to his revolt in
1173, and therefore to his departure from England about the close of
1172. On the other hand, the date must be subsequent to June 1170,
when the young king was crowned, and therefore probably to the
meeting at Fr&eacute;teval (July 22, 1170), at which the Archdeacon of
Canterbury was present.</p>

<p>Thus we obtain a limit of date. Within this limit we may exclude
the young king's stay in England after the departure of the two
archdeacons (December 1170), as also his subsequent presence in
England in 1171-2 while his father was in Ireland, for William fitz
Aldelin was in Ireland with him. Indeed, we are told by Giraldus
(v. 286) that when the king left Ireland (April 1172) William was
left behind in charge of Wexford.<a id="footnotetagyk7" name="footnotetagyk7"></a><a href="#footnoteyk7"><sup>7</sup></a>
As the young king then accompanied
his father over sea, the only period remaining (except
July-December 1170) to which we could assign the document is
August-November 1172, when he visited England, with his consort
Margaret, for his second coronation. This ceremony took place at
Winchester, but we cannot tell whether William fitz Aldelin had yet
returned from Ireland, or whether any other of our witnesses were
present on that occasion.<a id="footnotetagyk8" name="footnotetagyk8"></a><a href="#footnoteyk8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>But if we turn to the other possible period, the latter half of 1170,
we find an occasion when six of the witnesses to the above charter
can actually be shown to have been present, under circumstances of
peculiar interest, with the young king at Winchester.</p>

<p>The evidence of charters is so deficient at this period of the
reign that from August 1170 to June 1171, Mr Eyton could only
adduce two charters 'quite problematically' and one more 'safely',
as he claims, but erroneously, as his own pages show.<a id="footnotetagyk9" name="footnotetagyk9"></a><a href="#footnoteyk9"><sup>9</sup></a>
If, then, our<span class="pagenum"><a name="page383" id="page383"></a>[pg 383]</span>
charter belongs to this period, its evidence is proportionately valuable.
Now all that we know of the movements of the young king at
the time is that he was at Westminster on October 5th, and that he
kept his Christmas at Winchester. Mr Eyton's book must here be
used with great caution. He has been misled by R. de Diceto (i.
342)<a id="footnotetagyk10" name="footnotetagyk10"></a><a href="#footnoteyk10"><sup>10</sup></a>
into the statement that Henry was at Woodstock when
Becket sought to visit him in December; and adds&mdash;by a confusion,
it would seem, with his October movements&mdash;'The young king is at
Windsor' (December 4th<a id="footnotetagyk11" name="footnotetagyk11"></a><a href="#footnoteyk11"><sup>11</sup></a>).
Henry was neither at Woodstock nor
Windsor at this time, but at Winchester. Becket's biographers are
unanimous in stating that he sent his envoy before him to the
young king at Winchester.</p>

<p>Landing on December 1st, and entering Canterbury next day,
the primate (says William fitz Stephen), 'post octo dierum moram in
sede',<a id="footnotetagyk12" name="footnotetagyk12"></a><a href="#footnoteyk12"><sup>12</sup></a>
sent Richard, prior of Dover (who was destined to be his
own successor), to the young king to ask permission to visit him
'tanquam regem et dominum suum'. Richard 'veniens Wintoniam,
regem invenit, ubi optimates regni ... coegerat'.<a id="footnotetagyk13" name="footnotetagyk13"></a><a href="#footnoteyk13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>The purpose of this special assembly was connected with the
scheme for an irregular election to the vacant sees, at the court of
the elder king, by deputations whom his son was to send over.<a id="footnotetagyk14" name="footnotetagyk14"></a><a href="#footnoteyk14"><sup>14</sup></a>
Prior Richard was confronted by the young king's guardians (three
of whom attest our charter).<a id="footnotetagyk15" name="footnotetagyk15"></a><a href="#footnoteyk15"><sup>15</sup></a>
He himself, on receiving the application,
sent (as I read it) to consult Geoffrey Ridel, who was
believed to know his father's wishes, and who, with the Archdeacon
of Poitiers, was at Southampton, waiting to cross.<a id="footnotetagyk16" name="footnotetagyk16"></a><a href="#footnoteyk16"><sup>16</sup></a>
Turning, for their movements, to William fitz Stephen, we learn
that, while on their way to cross from a Kentish port, the two archdeacons,
on entering the county, learnt that the primate had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page384" id="page384"></a>[pg 384]</span>
arrived at Canterbury, and, turning their horses' heads, made for a
more westerly port.<a id="footnotetagyk17" name="footnotetagyk17"></a><a href="#footnoteyk17"><sup>17</sup></a>
Southampton clearly was the port they made
for, and on their way thither they must have visited the young king
at Winchester. This is admitted in the case of Geoffrey, who went
there, says Becket, to lay before him the complaint of the excommunicated
bishops.</p>

<p>I believe that our charter belongs to this occasion, when the two
attesting archdeacons were at Winchester. <i>Reg'</i> no doubt is Earl
Reginald of Cornwall, who was certainly present at the same
time<a id="footnotetagyk18" name="footnotetagyk18"></a><a href="#footnoteyk18"><sup>18</sup></a>
and who is probably referred to in 'li cunte' of Garnier. This
will establish the presence of six of our witnesses. Of the others,
Richard de Luci takes precedence as justiciar; Alan de Nevill,
Thomas Basset, and the great Glanville were, like the two archdeacons
and the three guardians of the king, members of the judicial
body; Humfrey de Bohun, Gilbert Malet, and Manasser Bisset were
present as officers of the household; John, constable of Chester, was
(then or afterwards) son-in-law to the grantee's wife, and Geoffrey
de Say was the son of the earl's aunt; Osbert fitz Richard and David
de Jarpenville (probably John de Rochelle also) were among the
earl's feudal tenants and are found attesting another of his charters;
and Hasculf was the enterprising chaplain who had plotted to carry
off the late earl's corpse and present it to the nuns of Chicksand.
The only person whose presence need puzzle us is the Earl of Essex
himself; for William fitz Stephen<a id="footnotetagyk19" name="footnotetagyk19"></a><a href="#footnoteyk19"><sup>19</sup></a>
asserts that he was despatched
from Henry's court after the arrival there of the excommunicated
prelates and the Archdeacon of Poitou. Either, then, he had
previously paid a flying visit to Winchester, or he must have been
absent when this transaction was recorded.</p>

<p class="footnote1"><a id="footnoteyk1" name="footnoteyk1"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotetagyk1"><sup>1</sup></a>
Madox gives a misleading reference. The charter occurs among the Clavering
enrolments of m. 17 (not 19) of the L.T.R. Memoranda of the Exchequer, containing
the Mich&aelig;lmas <cite>communia</cite> of 5 Edward II.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="footnoteyk2" name="footnoteyk2"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotetagyk2"><sup>2</sup></a>

Foss (<cite>Judges of England</cite>, i. 235) states positively that Hugh de Gundeville did
not leave Ireland till 1173, at the time of the rebellion. This, if true, would dispose
at once of an 1172 date for our charter; but, unfortunately, he does not give his
authority, and I have not succeeded in finding it.</p>

(July 22nd). But he is known to have been with the young king at Westminster on

<h3>THE FIRST KNOWN FINE (1175)</h3><!-- ff -->

<p>In his masterly introduction to <cite>Select Pleas of the Crown</cite>,<a id="footnotetagff1" name="footnotetagff1"></a><a href="#footnoteff1"><sup>1</sup></a>
Professor Maitland, with his usual skill, discusses the evolution of the <cite>Curia
Regis</cite> and the relation of the central to the itinerant courts. An
appendix to this introduction is devoted to 'early fines'; and the
conclusion arrived at, as to the date when regular fines began, is
that 'the evidence seems to point to the year 1178 or thereabouts,
just, that is, to the time when King Henry was remodelling the Curia
Regis; thenceforward we have traces of a fairly continuous series of
fines' (p. xxvii). More definitely still, in his latest work, he traces the
existence of fines 'from the year 1179'.</p>

<p>The earlier document I here print from the valuable cartulary
of Evesham (<cite>Vesp.</cite> B. xxiv., fo. 71, etc.) is, I contend, a true fine, and
is fortunately dated with exactitude (July 20th):</p>

<blockquote><p>
H&aelig;c est finalis concordia facta in curia domini Regis apud Evesham ad
proximum festum sancte Margarete post mortem comitis Reginaldi<a id="footnotetagff2" name="footnotetagff2"></a><a href="#footnoteff2"><sup>2</sup></a>
Cornub' coram Willelmo filio Audelini et Willelmo filio Radulfi et Willelmo
Basset et aliis justiciariis domini regis qui ibi tunc aderant, inter Rogerum
filium Willelmi et Robertum Trunket de terra de Ragl' unde placitum fuit
inter eos in curia domini Regis. Scilicet quod predictus Wibertus Trunket
clamavit quietam predicto Rogero terram illam de Ragl' et [<i>sic</i>] feud[um]
et hereditatem suam et totum jus suum quod in predicta terra habebat, et
ipse trunchet reddidit in curia domini Regis terram illam de Ragl' in manu
[<i>sic</i>] abbatis de Evesham, et ipse abbas ibi statim in curia Regis reddidit eam
predicto Rogero. Pro hac autem concessione dedit predictus Rogerus predicto
trunchet xx. marcas argenti, et predictus abbas dedit truchet unum
anulum argenteum cum cural.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The transcript of this fine is immediately followed by a royal
charter confirming it, and establishing Roger in possession:</p>

<blockquote><p>
H. dei gratia ... Sciatis me concessisse et presenti carta confirmasse finem
que factus fuit in curia mea inter, etc., etc. ... et Wibertus eam reddidit
solutam et quietam in manu abbatis de evesham de cujus feodo terra illa
est.... Et ideo volo et firmiter precipio.... Test. Willelmo Audelin', Willelmo
filio Radulfi, Willelmo Basset, Berteram de Verdun, Gaufrido Salvagio.
Apud Evesham.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr Eyton, to whom this fine was unknown, does not, in his <cite>Court
and Itinerary of Henry II</cite>, include Evesham among the places visited
by the king in 1175, but makes him visit Feckenham about October
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page386" id="page386"></a>[pg 386]</span>
(p. 196). But as we learn from the above fine that Henry was at
Evesham on July 20th, Mr Eyton's conclusions must be reconsidered.
Henry, according to him, was at Woodstock July 8th and at
Nottingham August 1st. Now this latter date is derived from a
Nottingham charter (p. 193), among the witnesses to which are
William fitz Audelin 'Dapifer', William Basset, and William fitz
Ralf, the very three justices before whom our fine had been levied at
Evesham on July 20th. I hold, therefore, that Henry proceeded
(possibly through Lichfield, as Mr Eyton asserts) from Woodstock
to Nottingham <i>via</i> Evesham; and, further, that he visited Feckenham
(to the north of Evesham) on this occasion, and not, as Mr
Eyton imagined, in October. We find accordingly that of the Feckenham
charters quoted by that writer (p. 196), one is witnessed by
all three of our officers, William fitz Audelin 'Dapifer', William
fitz Ralf, and William Basset; one by William fitz Audelin and
William fitz Ralf; and the third by William fitz Ralf and William
Basset.</p>

<p>Now, working from the Pipe-Rolls, Mr Eyton discovered that:</p>

<blockquote><p>
while the king was in Staffordshire there were pleas held in that county
which are expressed to have been held by William fitz Ralph, Bertram de
Verdon, and William Basset <i>in curia Regis</i> (p. 193).
</p></blockquote>

<p>He also noted that</p>

<blockquote><p>
the Pipe-Roll of 1175, after duly recounting the results of the ordinary
assizes, held by William de Lanvall and Thomas Basset (who appear to have
visited York while the king was there), contains the following (in regard to a
different kind of judicature than that at which the two justiciars presided),
and which probably took place in a court of which the king in person was
president:</p>

<p>'Placita et conventiones per Willelmum filius Radulfi, Bertram de Verdon,
et Willelmum Basset, in curia Regis.' These <i>Placita</i> were apparently
nothing more than fines with the crown (p. 194).
</p></blockquote>

<p>So, too, he found that at Northampton</p>

<blockquote><p>
the three justiciars who had attended him in his special <i>curia</i> in Staffordshire
and at York, negotiated a fine by Robert de Nevill, 'pro rehabenda saisina
de Uppetona qu&aelig; fuit Radulfi de Waltervilla' (p. 194).
</p></blockquote>

<p>My own evidence proves that the same three justiciars had been
with him, earlier in the summer, in his special <i>curia</i> at Evesham,
where an actual fine was levied.</p>

<p>Thus we have proof that in the summer of 1175 the king was
accompanied on his progress by a special group of justices, with
whose assistance he held pleas, just as, a generation later, John, in
his ninth year, 'was journeying about the country with three
judges in his train&mdash;Simon Pateshull, Potterne, and Pont Audemer'.<a id="footnotetagff3" name="footnotetagff3"></a><a href="#footnoteff3"><sup>3</sup></a>
While he was doing this, as Eyton has shown, two great eyres were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page387" id="page387"></a>[pg 387]</span>
going on throughout the country, one of them conducted by
William de Lanvall[ei] and Thomas Basset, the other by Ranulf de
Glanville and Hugh de Cressi. It is noteworthy that all these four
are found, with William fitz Audelin, among the witnesses to a
royal charter assigned by Mr Eyton&mdash;rightly, no doubt&mdash;to the
king's stay at York (<i>circ.</i> August 10, 1175), as they also are among
the witnesses to the Nottingham charter mentioned above (p. 385),
assigned by Eyton to August 1st. The latter, therefore, brings together
the king's own party of three or four justices with the four
justices in eyre.</p>

<p>The great importance of this royal <i>iter</i> consists in its bearing on the
evolution of the <i>curia regis</i>. The years 1175 and 1176 form a critical
epoch in this institutional development. Dr Stubbs, writing on this
subject, reminds us that 'the first <i>placita curi&aelig; regis</i> mentioned by
Madox are in 1175' (i. 600), and speaks of the 'two circuits of
the justices in 1175, and the six circuits of the judges in 1176'
(<cite>ibid.</cite>). So far, indeed, all is clear. The two judicial eyres of 1175 are
known to us from the Pipe-Rolls; the six of 1176 are found in the
chronicles also, for they were settled by the Assize of Northampton
in January of that year (i. 484-5). The really difficult subject is the
king's own <i>iter</i>, for which, we have seen, there is clear evidence, but
of which Dr Stubbs, working from Madox, seems to have been
unaware. His words are:</p>

<blockquote><p>
All the eighteen justices of 1176 were officers of the Exchequer; some of
them are found in 1175 holding 'placita curi&aelig; regis' in bodies of three or
four judges, and not in the same combinations in which they took their
judicial journeys. We can scarcely help the conclusion that the new jurisprudence
was being administered by committees of the general body of
justices, who were equally qualified to sit in the Curia and Exchequer, and
to undertake the fiscal and judicial work of the eyre.</p>

<p>[<i>Note</i>: For instance, in 1176, William fitz Ralf, Bertram de Verdun, and
William Basset hear pleas in Curia Regis touching Bucks. and Beds.; yet
on the eyre, these two counties are visited by three other judges, etc.]
</p></blockquote>

<p>These statements are based on Madox's extracts from the Pipe-Rolls,<a id="footnotetagff4" name="footnotetagff4"></a><a href="#footnoteff4"><sup>4</sup></a>
which afford, however, more definite evidence than Dr
Stubbs discovered. In the Pipe-Roll of 1175 and its immediate
successor we find 'Placita <i>in Curia Regis</i>' held by a single group of
judges&mdash;William fitz Ralf, Bertram de Verdon, and William Basset
(Thomas Basset is a substitute in one case and William fitz Audelin,
we have seen, in another)&mdash;quite distinct from the 'placita' of the
justices in eyre, which were not described as 'in curia regis'. The
view, therefore, that I now advance is that these pleas, 'in curia regis',
were held by a separate group of judges in the train of the king
himself, whose <i>iter</i> began at Reading, June 1175.<a id="footnotetagff5" name="footnotetagff5"></a><a href="#footnoteff5"><sup>5</sup></a>
It was there, I <span class="pagenum"><a name="page388" id="page388"></a>[pg 388]</span>
believe, that were held the 'placita' for Bucks and Beds, duly
recorded in the Pipe-Roll of 1175. That this royal <i>iter</i> was continued
through the Exchequer year 1175-6 seems to be well established,
and the chronological difficulty of distinguishing between the two
years renders the discovery of a fixed point, such as that afforded by
the Evesham fine, of special value. Its evidence also establishes the
presence of the king in person,<a id="footnotetagff6" name="footnotetagff6"></a><a href="#footnoteff6"><sup>6</sup></a>
whose charter of confirmation
should be carefully noted on account of its reciting the fine.</p>

<p>Having now traced the royal <i>iter</i>, of which the pleas are distinguished
on the Pipe-Rolls as held 'in curia regis', I turn to the
circuits of the judges. I have fortunately lighted, in the course of my
researches, on two more fines earlier than any known to Professor
Maitland. And, better still, one of these is the original document
itself. The date of the first is July 1 and of the second June 29,
1176. The justices named in each case are those who are known
to have gone the circuits, in which Leicester and Oxford were
respectively comprised.<a id="footnotetagff7" name="footnotetagff7"></a><a href="#footnoteff7"><sup>7</sup></a>
The importance of these documents
demands that they should be printed <i>in extenso</i>.</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>It will be observed that the Oxford fine is described as made 'in
curia regis', while the Leicester one is not. It would seem, then, that
in spite of the distinction drawn at first on the rolls, the phrase
'curia regis' was already creeping in as describing a court at which
the king was not present.</p>

<p>I have also discovered, in MS., a 'fine' of some ten or twelve
years earlier, most valuable for comparison with those which I have
here discussed. We have there a similar charter of confirmation, in
which the king describes the transaction as 'finem illum quem
Abbas Willelmus de Hulmo fecit coram me',<a id="footnotetagff12" name="footnotetagff12"></a><a href="#footnoteff12"><sup>12</sup></a>
and the document confirmed, moreover, describes itself as a 'finis' between the Abbot
of Holme and William and Henry de Neville, brothers.<a id="footnotetagff13" name="footnotetagff13"></a><a href="#footnoteff13"><sup>13</sup></a>
But the form is very different from that of the true fine, which is fully
developed in our example of 1175. The Holme 'fine' may be safely
assigned to March 1163-March 1166,<a id="footnotetagff14" name="footnotetagff14"></a><a href="#footnoteff14"><sup>14</sup></a>
and as it was 'made' at Westminster, it not improbably belongs to the series of proceedings
there <i>circ.</i> March 8, 1163. It may fairly be presumed that if, at the
date of this fine, the fully developed form existed it would have been
duly employed at Westminster on this occasion. We may therefore
safely assert, at least, that it came into use between the dates of these
two transactions.</p>

<p>As bearing on the evolution of the fine, the charter of Henry II,
confirming a 'finis et concordia', and assigned by me to 1163-70,<a id="footnotetagff15" name="footnotetagff15"></a><a href="#footnoteff15"><sup>15</sup></a>
ought to be compared with the Holme charter, as indicating,
perhaps, some advance, through the close resemblance between the
clauses, in these royal charters, confirming the fine points to an
almost common stage of development.</p>

<p>The part played by William fitz Audelin in the affairs, at this
time, of Ireland, gives also some importance to this proof of his
presence at Evesham on July 20, 1175. It brings us, indeed, in
contact with the great 'Laudabiliter' controversy. Miss Norgate
holds that William fitz Audelin was sent to Ireland in charge (with
the Prior of Wallingford) of that contested document in 1175.<a id="footnotetagff16" name="footnotetagff16"></a><a href="#footnoteff16"><sup>16</sup></a>
Professor Tout, in his biography of William, writes on the contrary,
oddly enough, that he was 'sent in 1174 or 1175' [<i>sic</i>] on this mission,
but 'soon left Ireland, for he appears as a witness of the treaty of
Falaise in October 1174 [<i>sic</i>], and in 1175 and 1176 he was constantly
in attendance at court in discharge of his duties as steward or
seneschal'.<a id="footnotetagff17" name="footnotetagff17"></a><a href="#footnoteff17"><sup>17</sup></a>
This confusion, however, is slight when compared with
the statements as to William's tenure of the government of Ireland.
It is agreed that he was sent to succeed Earl Richard (who died
April 5, 1176); but while Miss Norgate holds that 'early in the
next year Henry found it necessary to recall him',<a id="footnotetagff18" name="footnotetagff18"></a><a href="#footnoteff18"><sup>18</sup></a>
Professor Tout places his recall in 1179, consequent on complaints against him to
the king in January of that year. Without undertaking to decide the
question, I may suggest that William had returned to England by
May 1177&mdash;for he is proved by charters to have attended the
Oxford council of that date&mdash;when Henry replaced him, as governor,
by Hugh de Lacy, but entrusted him, as Hoveden states, with
Wexford. We have only to assume that Gerald, by mistake, assigns
to 1172 his Wexford appointment, which really belonged to 1177
(Professor Tout thinks this probable), and then the solution I
suggest satisfies all the requirements.</p>

<p>William fitz Audelin, I may add, has been peculiarly the sport
of genealogists. Having been selected by them as ancestor to the
great Irish house of Burke ('De Burgo') he was further transformed,
by a flight of fancy even wilder than usual, into a lineal descendant
of Charlemagne. Who he really was seems to have remained unknown,
for his life in the <cite>Dictionary of National Biography</cite> treats with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page391" id="page391"></a>[pg 391]</span>
suspicion, though duly mentioning, his alleged descent from Charlemagne.
Moreover, his very name would seem to have been left in
doubt. It would, of course, be difficult to distinguish 'Aldelinus' from
'Aldelmus' in MS., and I confess to having looked on the latter&mdash;which
is the form adopted by Professor Tout in the <cite>Dictionary of
National Biography</cite>, as by Miss Norgate and others&mdash;as probable
enough from its likeness to the English 'Aldhelm'. But the 'fitz
Audeline' of the Anglo-Norman poem on the Conquest of Ireland
seems decisive. 'Willelmus filius Audelini, domini regis dapifer' was
the style he used in his own charters.<a id="footnotetagff19" name="footnotetagff19"></a><a href="#footnoteff19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p>Having always kept a look-out for him in Yorkshire, I recognized
William at once in a charter which is among those abstracted in the
Report on the Portland MSS.<a id="footnotetagff20" name="footnotetagff20"></a><a href="#footnoteff20"><sup>20</sup></a>
This is a confirmation by Roger de
Mowbray of a grant to Fountains by 'Aldelin de Aldefeld and Ralph
his son and his other sons'. Among the witnesses are 'Ralph son of
Aldelin, William his brother', and at the close, 'Amelin son of
Aldel'. Now, if we turn to the <cite>cart&aelig;</cite> of 1166, we find, under Yorkshire,
that Ralph 'filius Aldelin' held half a knight's fee of Roger de Mowbray,
and William filius Aldelin one fee of Henry de Lacy. Here we
recognize the two brothers mentioned in the charters above.<a id="footnotetagff21" name="footnotetagff21"></a><a href="#footnoteff21"><sup>21</sup></a>
The small fief of William 'filius Aldelin' himself is entered under Hampshire,
where it is described as 'terra quam dominus Rex dedit
Willelmo filio Aldelin, Marscallo suo, cum Juliana filia Roberti
Dorsnelli'.</p>

<p>It is through this Juliana that we obtain the coping-stone of proof.
Her charter granting Little Maplestead, Essex, to the Hospitallers,
has for its first witness 'Radulfo filio Adelini', who, as we have seen
above, was her husband's brother.<a id="footnotetagff22" name="footnotetagff22"></a><a href="#footnoteff22"><sup>22</sup></a>
And he is also the first witness
to William's confirmation of her gift.<a id="footnotetagff23" name="footnotetagff23"></a><a href="#footnoteff23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<p>The parentage and the true name of William fitz Audelin are
thus, at length, clearly established.</p>

<h3>THE MONTMORENCY IMPOSTURE</h3><!-- mi -->

<p>Many a jest has been levelled at the Irish family of Morres for
seeking and obtaining permission from the Crown, some eighty years
ago, to assume the glorious name of 'De Montmorency', in lieu of
their own, as having been originally that of their family.<a id="footnotetagmi1" name="footnotetagmi1"></a><a href="#footnotemi1"><sup>1</sup></a>
They have since borne, as is well known, not merely the name, but even
the arms and the proud device of that illustrious house. Moreover,
the introduction of the name Bouchard, borne by the present Lord
Mountmorres, proves the determination of the family to persist in
their lofty pretensions.</p>

<p>I am not aware whether these pretensions have ever been regularly
exposed: they seem to have been thought too fantastic for
serious criticism. At the same time, it must be remembered that they
have been formally and officially recognized by Sir W. Betham as
Deputy Ulster, by the English crown (on the strength of his statement)
and by the Chevalier De la Rue, 'garde-g&eacute;n&eacute;ral des archives
du Royaume', on the French side, in 1818. On the other hand, it
must not be forgotten that MM. de Montmorency at the time, in
spite of the repeated and strenuous appeals of the Morres family,
declined to admit their claim to be members of the house of
Montmorency.</p>

<p>To the indignant protest of Col. Hervey Morres (styling himself
'de Montmorency-Morres') against this action of the French
house, we owe the most complete exposition of the case on behalf of
his family.<a id="footnotetagmi2" name="footnotetagmi2"></a><a href="#footnotemi2"><sup>2</sup></a>
On it, therefore, my criticisms will be based. Nor will
these criticisms be destructive only: they will show that the pedigrees
upheld by Col. Morres and his opponents were both alike erroneous,
and will establish the real facts, which, it will be found, completely
vindicate the accuracy of Giraldus Cambrensis.</p>

<p>The controversy hinged on a well-known personage. 'Herveius de
Monte Mauricii', as Giraldus terms him. The French house, taking
their stand on the historians of their family, insisted that he was the
only Montmorency who had gone to Ireland in his time, and that
as he had, admittedly, left no legitimate issue, the Morres claim was
untenable. The Irish house contended that, on the contrary, others
of the family had come over also, and that they were lineally descended
from one of Hervey's brothers, but the whole story undoubtedly
sprang from the mention of this Hervey&mdash;the sole connecting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page393" id="page393"></a>[pg 393]</span>
link&mdash;and from the curious form in which Giraldus chose to
latinize his name.</p>

<p>Now Duchesne, the historian of the house of Montmorency, whose
version Desormeaux and P&egrave;re Anselme did but follow in the main,
wrote thus of Hervey:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Il espousa Elizabeth de Meullent veuve de Gislebert de Claire, Comte
de Pembroc en Angleterre et m&egrave;re de Richard de Claire, surnomm&eacute;
Strongbow, Comte de Pembroke, dompteur de l'Hibernie, duquel &agrave; raison
de cette alliance un Autheur du temps le qualifie parastre ou beaup&egrave;re
(p. 92).<a id="footnotetagmi3" name="footnotetagmi3"></a><a href="#footnotemi3"><sup>3</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>But this 'Autheur' is Giraldus Cambrensis, on whom Duchesne
based his account, and who, we find, does not speak of Hervey as
stepfather, but as paternal uncle of Strongbow:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Herveius de Monte Mauricii, vir quoque fugitivus a facie fortun&aelig;, inermis
et inops, ex parte Richardi comitis cujus <i>patruus</i> erat, explorator potius quam
expugnator advenit (i. 3).
</p></blockquote>

<p>Duchesne's version, therefore, is out of court, although it was repeated
by P&egrave;re Anselme, and even adopted in the <cite>Genealogist</cite> by so
skilled and able a genealogist as Mr G. W. Watson.<a id="footnotetagmi4" name="footnotetagmi4"></a><a href="#footnotemi4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>Col. Hervey Morres went so far as to accuse Duchesne and
Desormeaux 'd'adulation, d'immoralit&eacute;, et de mauvaise foi' in
giving this account of his great namesake; and he proceeded to
substitute a version of his own, severing the hapless man and converting
him into two! To make this clear, I must print the essential
part of the pedigree as given by him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px"><img src="images/393-400.png" width="400" height="360" alt="Family tree" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page394" id="page394"></a>[pg 394]</span></p>
<p>The explanation is extremely simple: the whole pedigree is concocted
with a view to making the Irish Hervey uncle to Robert
fitz Stephen. This was done to satisfy the supposed requirements of
Giraldus, whose words Col. Morres thus triumphantly quoted:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Robertus Stephanides ... Inter c&aelig;teros <i>Herveius de Montemaurisco</i> <span class="sc">Roberti
patruus</span>, <i>nepoti suo se</i> comitem pr&aelig;buit (p. 77).
</p></blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately for him, he had gone, not to Giraldus, but to 'Stonyhurst
de rebus Hibernicis i. 69-70, <i>d'apr&egrave;s Giraldus Cambrensis'</i>.
Stonyhurst had carelessly made Giraldus speak of Hervey as uncle,
not to Earl Richard, but to Robert fitz Stephen, and the pedigree
was accordingly constructed to fit this error. When the error is corrected,
the pedigree collapses; and the very passage which is quoted
to confirm it at once unmasks the concoction.</p>

<p>And now having made it clear that both sides were in error, I shall
set forth the true explanation of the words of Giraldus. The clue is
given us by those Deeping charters which, oddly enough, Col.
Morres duly quoted and appealed to. The first is found in the
<cite>Monasticon</cite>, ii. 601:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Adeliz, uxor Gilberti filii Ricardi et Gillebertus, et Baldewinus, et
Rohaisia pueri Gilberti episcopo Lincolniensi ... salutem.... Hiis testibus,
Gilberto filio Gilberti, Galterio, <i>Herv&aelig;o</i>, Baldwino fratribus ejus et Rohaisia
sorore eorum, etc., etc.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The next is the confirmation of this grant by Robert Bishop of
Lincoln (ob. 1123) as 'donum Adelid&aelig; <i>de Montemoraci</i>' (p. 602). The
third is a charter of 'Adeliz, mater comitis Gilberti' (p. 603), who is
also styled in the Thorney Register 'Adelitia de Claromonte'. Col.
Morres also relied much on a grant to Castleacre by 'Adalicia de
Claromonte', to which the first witness is 'Her. de Montemorentino',<a id="footnotetagmi5" name="footnotetagmi5"></a><a href="#footnotemi5"><sup>5</sup></a>
but the relationship of the witness to the grantor is not stated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page395" id="page395"></a>[pg 395]</span></p>
<p>Hervey de Montmorency is also mentioned in the Bilegh Abbey
confirmation charter of Richard I, but it gives us no information.</p>

<p>We have now, however, sufficient evidence to recover the true
genealogy, which is interesting enough. This shows us how Hervey
was 'paternal uncle' to Strongbow,<a id="footnotetagmi6" name="footnotetagmi6"></a><a href="#footnotemi6"><sup>6</sup></a>
and why he witnessed his
mother's charter (<i>ut supra</i>) with his brothers and sister, but did not
join in their grant. We see, also, how Duchesne's error arose from
his making the widow not of Gilbert, but of his son and namesake
the first Earl of Pembroke, marry a Montmorenci. The error is not
surprising in the case of such a family as the Clares, whose alliances
and ramifications are made specially puzzling by the repetition of
their Christian names.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the 'dimidiation' of Hervey in the pedigree
put forward by the Morres family was merely the fruit of the resolve
to make him at all costs uncle to Robert fitz Stephen, as the words
of Giraldus were supposed to require, in their misquoted form.</p>

<p>Poor Hervey has, indeed, been the sport of genealogists and historians.
Mr Dimock, in his Rolls edition of Giraldus, renders his
name as 'Mont-Maurice', Miss Norgate as 'Mountmorris',<a id="footnotetagmi7" name="footnotetagmi7"></a><a href="#footnotemi7"><sup>7</sup></a>
Mrs Green as Mount Moriss,<a id="footnotetagmi8" name="footnotetagmi8"></a><a href="#footnotemi8"><sup>8</sup></a>
Mr Hunt, who has written his life in the
<cite>Dictionary of National Biography</cite> as Mount-Maurice, and even Mr
Orpen, in his admirable edition of the Anglo-Norman poem on the
Conquest, as 'Montmaurice' (p. 335). This last is the strangest case,
because the forms found in the poem are 'Mumoreci' and 'Momorci',
while, as Mr Orpen duly points out, it is 'Munmoreci' in the Register
of St Thomas's, and 'Mundmorici' in the Cartulary of St Mary's
(p. 266). Hervey was constable to his nephew Earl Richard's troops
in Ireland, and described himself as 'Marescallus Domini Regis de
Hibernia, et senescallus de tota terra Ricardi Comitis'.</p>

<p>Having now shown that the alleged descent can be absolutely disproved
so far as concerns the only Montmorenci whose name occurs
in connection with Ireland, I proceed to glance at his supposed relatives,
none of whom, it is important to remember, even bore the
name of Montmorency.</p>

<p>The chart pedigree printed above (p. 357) will show how Robert
fitz Stephen was converted into a Montmorenci, though the
parentage of his father Stephen, constable of Cardigan, is wholly
unknown. It need scarcely be said that no proof is, or can be, given
for this filiation; but the following passage on Stephen is an excellent
illustration of the sort of evidence which is vouched for this wholly
imaginary pedigree:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page396" id="page396"></a>[pg 396]</span></p>

<blockquote><p>
Ce seigneur, tr&egrave;s-jeune encore, en 1087, confirma conjointement avec son
p&egrave;re et son a&iuml;eul Herv&eacute;, fils de Bouchard, la donation faite par Turillus le
Gros &agrave; l'abbaye de St. Florent de Saumur de certaines b&eacute;n&eacute;fices.</p>

<p>Sig. Hervei filii Burchardi, Sig. Roberti filii ejus, Sig. Stephani militis
ejus.
</p></blockquote>

<p>All that is needed, we are told, is to read grandson ('petit fils')
instead of <i>filius</i> for Robert, and great-grandson for <i>miles</i>&mdash;on the
ground that <i>miles</i> sometimes meant 'un jeune homme'! Such is a
type of the 'proofs' on which this pedigree rests. But its absurdities
and inconsistencies go even further than this. The dates work out
as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 240px"><img src="images/396-240.png" width="240" height="324" alt="Family tree" /></div>

<p>Thus Stephen, who was born about 1080, and was a witness in 1087,
would be <em>son</em> to a man who flourished in 1166, and <em>brother</em> to men
who died in 1205 and 1211.<a id="footnotetagmi9" name="footnotetagmi9"></a><a href="#footnotemi9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>But what are we to say when we learn further that this Stephen,
who died in '1136', is the 'Stephanus de Marisco' who appears in
the <cite>Liber Niger</cite> as a tenant of the Bishop of Ely in 1166! The probable,
and indeed only, explanation is that Col. Morres did not even know
when the returns in the <cite>Liber Niger</cite> were compiled. Their real date
again destroys this cock-and-bull pedigree, or genealogical nightmare,
which, for sheer topsy-turveydom, has, I venture to assert,
never been surpassed.</p>

<p>I strongly suspect that the whole story arose from the occurrence
in Ireland, in the thirteenth century, of the latinized name 'De
Marisco' or 'De Mariscis', which represents of course, neither Montmorenci
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page397" id="page397"></a>[pg 397]</span>
nor Morres, but simply Marsh. Genealogists, no doubt,
were attracted by the form 'De Monte Maurisco' into tracing a connection;
but, so far as can be understood, Col. Morres discarded
this resemblance, and represented his alleged ancestors as 'seigneurs
de Mariscis ou des marches' in England, connecting them with the
fen district in Cambridgeshire. It would be easy to show that the
early pedigree positively teems with absurdities similar to those I
have already exposed, but it would be sheer waste of time to devote
any more attention to proofs, which Col. Morres proudly boasted
were 'v&eacute;rifi&eacute;s avec la plus scrupuleuse attention par l'autorit&eacute; competente
et sanctionn&eacute;s d&eacute;sormais par l'autorisation du prince qui
gouverne aujourd'hui l'empire britannique' (p. 25).</p>

<p>I do not hesitate to say that a more impudent claim was never
successfully foisted on the authorities and the public. The chief
sinner in the matter was, of course, Sir W. Betham, who certified
(June 29, 1815) that this audacious concoction was 'established on
evidence of the most unquestionable authority, chiefly from the
ancient public records' (p. 203). The Crown naturally could only
accept the statement of its own officer of arms, and accordingly
described the alleged descent as being duly proved and recorded.<a id="footnotetagmi10" name="footnotetagmi10"></a><a href="#footnotemi10"><sup>10</sup></a>
As for the French expert, the Chevalier de la Rue, of whose investigation
and favourable verdict (April 17, 1818) so much has been
made, it will scarcely be believed that he actually, with the sole
exception of the <cite>Monasticon</cite>, did not attempt to verify the 'proofs' set
before him! It will be seen from his own words that his decision was
subject to their genuineness:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Toutes les citations puis&eacute;es par monsieur de Morr&egrave;s dans les monuments,
registres, et terriers publics d'Angleterre &eacute;tant, <i>comme je n'en doute pas</i>, aussi
exactes que celles du Monasticon (p. 37).
</p></blockquote>

<p>The value of his loudly-trumpeted verdict may be estimated from
this admission.</p>

<p>It is only right that MM. de Montmorency and all those in
France who are interested in historical genealogy should understand
that no one among ourselves, whose opinion is worth having, would
dream of defending this gross usurpation. We may hope and believe
that in the present day no officer of arms would behave like Sir W.
Betham, and certify, as 'established on evidence of the most unquestionable
authority' a descent which is not merely 'not proven',
but can be absolutely disproved. It cannot be stated too emphatically,
or known too widely, that the house of Morres has no more
right, by hereditary descent, to the name and arms of 'De Montmorency'
than any of the numerous families of Morris, or indeed, for
the matter of that, the family of Smith.<a id="footnotetagmi11" name="footnotetagmi11"></a><a href="#footnotemi11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<h3>THE OXFORD DEBATE ON FOREIGN SERVICE (1197)</h3><!-- od -->

<p>Great importance is rightly assigned to the first instances of 'a constitutional
opposition to a royal demand for money',<a id="footnotetagod1" name="footnotetagod1"></a><a href="#footnoteod1"><sup>1</sup></a>
of which the two alleged earliest cases are 'the opposition of St Thomas to the
king's manipulation of the danegeld [1163], and the refusal by St
Hugh of Lincoln to furnish money for Richard's war in France
[1197]'.<a id="footnotetagod2" name="footnotetagod2"></a><a href="#footnoteod2"><sup>2</sup></a>
These two precedents are always classed together: Dr
Stubbs writes of St Hugh's action:</p>

<blockquote><p>
The only formal resistance to the king in the national council proceeds
from St Hugh of Lincoln and Bishop Herbert of Salisbury, who refuse to consent
to grant him an aid in knights and money for his foreign warfare ... an
act which stands out prominently by the side of St Thomas's protest against
Henry's proposal to appropriate the sheriff's share of danegeld.<a id="footnotetagod3" name="footnotetagod3"></a><a href="#footnoteod3"><sup>3</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>And Mr Freeman repeats the parallel:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Thomas ... withstands, and withstands successfully, the levying of a
danegeld.... As Thomas of London had withstood the demands of the
father, Hugh of Avalon withstood the demands of the son. In a great council
... [he] spoke up for the laws and rights of Englishmen ... no men or
money were they bound to contribute for undertakings beyond the sea.<a id="footnotetagod4" name="footnotetagod4"></a><a href="#footnoteod4"><sup>4</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Having already discussed the earlier instance,<a id="footnotetagod5" name="footnotetagod5"></a><a href="#footnoteod5"><sup>5</sup></a>
and advanced the view that the Woodstock debate [1163] did not relate to danegeld at
all, but to an attempt of the king to seize for himself the <i>auxilium
vicecomitis</i> (a local levy) I now approach the later instance.</p>

<p>'This occasion,' we read, 'is a memorable one':<a id="footnotetagod6" name="footnotetagod6"></a><a href="#footnoteod6"><sup>6</sup></a>
it is that of an 'event of great importance',<a id="footnotetagod7" name="footnotetagod7"></a><a href="#footnoteod7"><sup>7</sup></a>
of 'a landmark in constitutional history'.<a id="footnotetagod8" name="footnotetagod8"></a><a href="#footnoteod8"><sup>8</sup></a>
No apology, therefore, is needed for endeavouring to throw
some further light on an event of such cardinal importance. But, to
clear the ground, let us first define what we mean by 'opposition to
a royal demand for money'. However autocratic the king may have
been&mdash;and on this point there is not only a difference of opinion but
a difference in fact corresponding with his strength at any given
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page399" id="page399"></a>[pg 399]</span>
period&mdash;there were limits set by law or custom (or, should we rather
say, limits, both written and unwritten?) beyond which he could not
pass. 'Domesday', for instance, was a written limit: if the king
claimed from a Manor assessed at ten hides the danegeld due from
twenty, the tenant need only appeal to 'Domesday' (<i>poneret se super
rotulum Winton'</i>). Or, again, if from a feudal tenant owing the forty
days' service the king were to claim eighty days, he would be transgressing
unwritten custom as binding as a written record. But outside
these limits there lay a debatable ground where that elastic
term <i>auxilium</i> proved conveniently expansive. It was here that the
crown could increase its demands, and here that a conflict would
arise as to where the limit should be placed, a conflict to be determined
not by law, but by a trial of strength between the crown and
its opponents. We have, then, to decide to which of these spheres the
action of St Hugh should be assigned, whether to that of the lawyer
appealing to the letter of the bond, or to that of the popular leader
opposing the demands of the king, though they did not contravene
the law. If one may use the terms, for convenience sake, it was a
question of law or a question of politics; and only if it was the latter
had it a true constitutional importance.</p>

<p>The two chief accounts of the Oxford debate are found in <cite>Roger
Hoveden</cite> and the <cite>Magna Vita St Hugonis</cite>. As they are both printed in
<cite>Select Charters</cite>, I need not repeat them here. There is, however, an
independent version in the <cite>Vita</cite> of Giraldus Cambrensis, which it
may be desirable to add:</p>

<blockquote><p>
In Anglicanam coepit [rex] ecclesiam duris exactionibus debacchari.
Unde collecto in unum regni clero, habitoque contra insolitum et tam
urgens incommodum districtiore consilio, verbum ad importunas pariter et
importabiles impositiones contradictionis et cleri totius pro ecclesiastica
libertate responsionis, in ore Lincolnensis tanquam personae prae ceteris
approbatae religionis authenticae magis communi omnium desiderio est
assignatum (vii. 103-4).
</p></blockquote>

<p>Gerald's editor impugns the correctness of these statements, on
the grounds that the assembly was not clerical merely and that the
bishop did not speak on behalf of the whole church. But the passage
seems to me to refer to a meeting of the clergy in which it was decided
that St Hugh should be their spokesman at the council. Of the
other objection I shall treat below.</p>

<p>According to Hoveden, Richard asked for either (1) three hundred
knights who would serve him, at their own costs, for a year, or (2) a
sum sufficient to enable him to hire three hundred knights for a year
at the rate of three shillings a day. The <cite>Magna Vita</cite>, however, implies
that the former alternative alone was laid before the council. The
grounds on which St Hugh protested are thus given by our two
authorities:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page400" id="page400"></a>[pg 400]</span></p>

<blockquote><p>
Respondit pro se, quod ipse in hoc voluntati regis nequaquam adquiesceret,
tum quia processu temporis in ecclesiae suae detrimentum redundaret,
tum quia successores sui dicerent, 'Patres nostri comederunt uvam acerbam,
et dentes filiorum obstupescunt' (Hoveden).</p>

<p>Scio equidem ad militare servitium domino regi, sed in hac terra solummodo
exhibendum, Lincolniensem ecclesiam teneri; extra metas vero
Angliae nil tale ab ea deberi. Unde mihi consultius arbitror ad natale
solum repedare ... quam hic pontificatum gerere et ecclesiam mihi commissam,
antiquas immunitates perdendo, insolitis angariis subjugare (<cite>Magna
Vita</cite>).
</p></blockquote>

<p>Two points stand out clearly&mdash;one that St Hugh took his stand
on the prescriptive rights of his church, rights infringed by the
king's demand; the other, that he spoke for himself alone, not for the
church, still less for the barons, and least of all for the nation. Our
authorities, however, are so vague that they leave in doubt the precise
point 'taken' by the saintly prelate. Mr Freeman, we have seen,
confidently assumes that he 'spoke up for the laws and rights of
Englishmen'; Miss Norgate holds that he took up the position of
Thomas and Anselm as 'a champion of constitutional liberty',<a id="footnotetagod9" name="footnotetagod9"></a><a href="#footnoteod9"><sup>9</sup></a>
whatever that may mean; even Dr Stubbs claims that he 'acted on
behalf of the nation to which he had joined himself'.<a id="footnotetagod10" name="footnotetagod10"></a><a href="#footnoteod10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>I venture to think that the clue to the enigma is to be found in
quite another quarter. In the chronicle of Jocelin de Brakelond we
find a most instructive passage, which refers, it cannot be doubted,
to the same episode. The story is told somewhat differently, but the
point raised is the same. King Richard, we are told, demanded that
knights should be sent him from England, in the proportion of one
from every ten due by the church 'baronies'. The <cite>servitium debitum</cite> of
St Edmund's being forty, the abbot was called upon to send four.<a id="footnotetagod11" name="footnotetagod11"></a><a href="#footnoteod11"><sup>11</sup></a>
That the principle of joint equipment, which had been adopted
under Henry II in 1157,<a id="footnotetagod12" name="footnotetagod12"></a><a href="#footnoteod12"><sup>12</sup></a>
and again I think by Longchamp in 1191,<a id="footnotetagod13" name="footnotetagod13"></a><a href="#footnoteod13"><sup>13</sup></a>
was resorted to on this occasion is the more probable because
a few years later (1205) we find King John similarly demanding
'quod novem milites per totam Angliam invenirent decimum militem,
bene paratum equis et armis, ad defensionem regni nostri'. I
admit, however, that it is not mentioned in the other versions of
our episode, and Jocelin speaks only of the demand upon the church
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page401" id="page401"></a>[pg 401]</span>
fiefs. But the point is that when the abbot consulted his tenants as to
sending the four knights required, they protested that they were
liable to pay scutage, but not to serve out of England.<a id="footnotetagod14" name="footnotetagod14"></a><a href="#footnoteod14"><sup>14</sup></a>
Now this is a <i>locus classicus</i> on the institution of scutage. Its bearing I shall examine
below, after finishing the story. The abbot, we read, finding himself
in a strait, crossed the sea in search of the king, who told him that a
fine would not avail; he wanted men, not money.<a id="footnotetagod15" name="footnotetagod15"></a><a href="#footnoteod15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p>Surely we have here the key to the position taken by St Hugh.
When he claimed that his fief was not bound 'ad servitium militare
... extra metas Angliae' he cannot have referred to the payment of
scutage, for that had been paid by his predecessors and himself without
infringing the liberties of their church.<a id="footnotetagod16" name="footnotetagod16"></a><a href="#footnoteod16"><sup>16</sup></a>
He must, therefore, have referred not to 'money', but to <em>personal</em> service outside the
realm. But was this exemption peculiar to the church of Lincoln?
If we find the same privilege existing at St Edmund's and at Salisbury,
may we not infer that the church contingents were only bound
to serve in person for 'defence, not defiance',<a id="footnotetagod17" name="footnotetagod17"></a><a href="#footnoteod17"><sup>17</sup></a>
and that we have here the perfect explanation of the fact that scutage, as commutation for
service, is an institution, when it first appears, peculiar to church
fiefs? The mediaeval dread of creating a precedent preyed on the
abbot as on the saint. From the council of Lillebonne to the Bedford
<i>auxilium</i> (1224) it was always the same cry:</p>

<div class="poem width18">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Creiment k'il seit en feu tornez</p>
<p>Et en costume seit tenu</p>
<p>Et par costume seit rendu.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>It was in this spirit that Hugh of Avalon, I take it, made his stand:
other prelates might waive the point, in consideration of the king's
necessities, but he, at least, would never allow a standing exemption
to be broken through and thus impaired for all time.</p>

<p>His attitude, we are told, proved fatal to the scheme, compelling
the king and his ministers to abandon it in impotent wrath. But
perhaps his biographer exaggerates the defeat, for the Bishop of
Salisbury, we know, had to purchase the king's pardon for his action
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page402" id="page402"></a>[pg 402]</span>
by a heavy fine, while the Abbot of St Edmund's had to compromise
the matter by the payment of a large sum.<a id="footnotetagod18" name="footnotetagod18"></a><a href="#footnoteod18"><sup>18</sup></a>
It seems probable that
similar compromises would be arranged in other cases where the
request was not complied with.</p>

<p>If, then, I am right in the solution I offer, St Hugh must have
taken the narrowest ground, and have acted on behalf of ecclesiastical
privilege, and only incidentally even for that, his protest being
limited to his own church.<a id="footnotetagod19" name="footnotetagod19"></a><a href="#footnoteod19"><sup>19</sup></a>
And, further, it follows that, like St
Thomas, he was acting strictly on the defensive. To say that his
action affords 'the first clear case of the refusal of a money grant demanded
directly by the crown, and a most valuable precedent, for
later times',<a id="footnotetagod20" name="footnotetagod20"></a><a href="#footnoteod20"><sup>20</sup></a>
is, I submit with all respect, to set it in a quite erroneous
light. In 1197, as in 1163, the crown was trying to infringe on
well-established rights, and St Hugh like St Thomas, resisted that
infringement, so far as his own rights were concerned, just as he
would have resisted an attempt of the crown to deprive his see of a
Manor, of feudal services, or of goods. The crown might take its
pound of flesh, but more than that it should not have; never, through
any action of his, should his church be deprived of its prescriptive
rights.<a id="footnotetagod21" name="footnotetagod21"></a><a href="#footnoteod21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p>Here this article originally closed; but I am tempted to refer to
one touching on the same subject which appeared a year later in the
pages of the same review.<a id="footnotetagod22" name="footnotetagod22"></a><a href="#footnoteod22"><sup>22</sup></a>
Alluding to 'the question of foreign
service' as a prominent grievance under John,<a id="footnotetagod23" name="footnotetagod23"></a><a href="#footnoteod23"><sup>23</sup></a>
I wrote:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page403" id="page403"></a>[pg 403]</span></p>

<blockquote><p>
Ralf of Coggeshall, and Walter of Coventry, assert that the northern
barons denied their liability to foreign service in respect of lands held in
England. John retorted that the principle had been admitted in the days of
his father and his brother, and therefore claimed it <i>tanquam debitum</i>. This
justifies the fears expressed sixteen years before by St Hugh of Lincoln, and
explains what I termed, in examining his action, the mediaeval dread of
creating a precedent.<a id="footnotetagod24" name="footnotetagod24"></a><a href="#footnoteod24"><sup>24</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>The final loss of Normandy had, of course, altered the case, but even
while it still formed part of an English King's possessions, there must
always have been scope for argument as to feudal obligations. To
quote once more from the same article:</p>

<blockquote><p>
The question must have been complicated by the growth of the king's
dominions. Did the feudatories owe service to the king, as their lord, in
whatever war he was engaged? Or were they only bound to follow him as
King of England? Or were they, as holding <i>a conquestu</i>, only bound to serve
in the dominions of the Conqueror who enfeoffed them, i.e. in England and
Normandy?<a id="footnotetagod25" name="footnotetagod25"></a><a href="#footnoteod25"><sup>25</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>On the death of the Conqueror, the question would arise for the
King of the English and the Duke of the Normans were no longer
one and the same. It comes to the front accordingly in a gathering
of the barons at Winchester, which Mr Freeman assigns to Easter,
1090.<a id="footnotetagod26" name="footnotetagod26"></a><a href="#footnoteod26"><sup>26</sup></a>
Orderic, here his authority, places it under 1089, and
although his chronology is not to be always blindly followed, there is
no ground for supposing here that the date is wrong. When he is
following out a story or carried on by allusion, Orderic, like other
chroniclers, anticipates or wanders in his dates; but this gathering
has no connection with what precedes or follows; there is, therefore,
nothing to account for his placing it under 1089, if it really belonged
to 1090.</p>

<p>But the point to which I would call attention is the nature and
intention of this gathering. Orderic writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Confirmatus itaque in regno, turmas optimatum ascivit, et Guentoni&aelig;
congregatis, qu&aelig; intrinsecus ruminabat sic ore deprompsit.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr Freeman attaches to the speech that follows no small importance.
Holding that the king 'was now ready to take the decisive step of
crossing the sea himself or sending others to cross it', he pointed out
that:</p>

<blockquote><p>
even William Rufus, in all his pride and self-confidence, knew that it did not
depend wholly on himself to send either native or adopted Englishmen on
such an errand. He had learned enough of English constitutional law not to
think of venturing on a foreign war without the constitutional sanction of his
kingdom. In a Gemot [<i>sic</i>] at Winchester, seemingly the Easter Gemot of the
third year of his reign, he laid his schemes before the assembled Witan [<i>sic</i>],
and obtained their consent to a war with the Duke of the Normans.<a id="footnotetagod27" name="footnotetagod27"></a><a href="#footnoteod27"><sup>27</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page404" id="page404"></a>[pg 404]</span></p>

<p>Of course, in reading Mr Freeman's works we must reconcile ourselves
to 'Gemot' and 'Witan' being thrust upon us at every turn,
however radically false a conception these words may convey. At the
close of his dealing with this episode, he refers us, as a parallel, to the
'full Gemot' of 1047, in which 'the popular character of the assembly
still', we learn, 'impresses itself on the language of history'. Now
Orderic describes those who were summoned to our Winchester
gathering as 'turmas optimatum'; he makes William begin his
speech 'nostri egregii barones'; and he places in his mouth language
essentially feudal and Norman:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Nunc igitur commoneo vos omnes, qui patris mei homines fuistis, et feudos
vestros in Normannia et Anglia de illo tenuistis<a id="footnotetagod28" name="footnotetagod28"></a><a href="#footnoteod28"><sup>28</sup></a>
... c&oelig;nobia qu&aelig; patres nostri construxerunt in Neustria ... Decet ergo ut, sicut nomen ejus [<i>i.e.</i>
Willelmi] et diadema gero, sic ad defensionem patri&aelig; inh&aelig;ream ejus [<i>i.e.</i>
Normanni&aelig;] studio.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr Freeman expressed astonishment and delight at William's 'constitutional
language', and declared that though, in its actual
wording, the speech, of course, was Orderic's:</p>

<blockquote><p>
the constitutional doctrines which he has worked into his speech cannot fail
to set forth the ordinary constitutional usage of the time. Even in the darkest
hour in which England had any settled government at all, etc., etc.<a id="footnotetagod29" name="footnotetagod29"></a><a href="#footnoteod29"><sup>29</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>And then follows the usual lament for 'the days of King Eadward',
when it was not a 'cabinet', but a crowd, that dealt with the delicate
question of peace or war.</p>

<p>Now even the late Professor's most ardent followers cannot represent
my criticism here as 'trifling', or unimportant. Mr Freeman, I
hold, had misconceived the matter altogether. The whole thing is
sheer delusion. William's appeal, as set before us, was not the fruit of
studies in English 'constitutional law': it was the appeal of a feudal
lord to 'barons' holding by feudal tenure. Should there be any one
who feels the slightest doubt upon the question, let him turn to Mr
Freeman's own account of the great 'Assembly of Lillebonne'. He
could not himself avoid a passing glance at the parallel, when he
wrote that 'William the Red had as good reasons to give for an
invasion of Normandy as his father had once had to give for an invasion
of England'.<a id="footnotetagod30" name="footnotetagod30"></a><a href="#footnoteod30"><sup>30</sup></a>
Contrasting that Assembly (1066) with an English
Gemot, he wrote that 'in William's Assembly we hear of none
but barons'.<a id="footnotetagod31" name="footnotetagod31"></a><a href="#footnoteod31"><sup>31</sup></a>
Precisely. But that remark is equally true of his son's
Assembly at Winchester.<a id="footnotetagod32" name="footnotetagod32"></a><a href="#footnoteod32"><sup>32</sup></a>
And when we learn, a few years later,
the composition of his Assembly, we find it admittedly restricted to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page405" id="page405"></a>[pg 405]</span>
tenants-in-chief.<a id="footnotetagod33" name="footnotetagod33"></a><a href="#footnoteod33"><sup>33</sup></a>
Of the two Assemblies, that of Lillebonne revealed
a more active opposition, showed more 'parliamentary boldness',
than that of Winchester.<a id="footnotetagod34" name="footnotetagod34"></a><a href="#footnoteod34"><sup>34</sup></a>
The latter merely applauded, we read, the King's appeal. Like his father, he appealed to his barons to
follow him on foreign service; like him also, he pleaded his wrongs
and the justice of his righteous cause.</p>

<p>Of the two, the father seems, as I have said, to have met with
more opposition than the son. One might therefore produce an
argument <i>ad absurdum</i>, and contend that, on Mr Freeman's showing,
an English King was not less, but more, absolute than a Norman
Duke. In any case we have now seen that the ideas about 'constitutional
usage', and so forth, imported here by Mr Freeman, were
nothing but a figment of his brain. The Assembly of Winchester no
more resulted from 'English constitutional law' than did the
Assembly of Lillebonne, convened for a similar purpose. William
Rufus had to deal with barons who could not be anxious to invade
Normandy merely to make him Duke of the Normans. If they had
any preference in the matter, it would be rather for Robert than
for William, for a weak rather than a strong ruler; but, apart from
preference, the barons would be loth to engage in internecine warfare
merely for the personal advantage of one brother or the other.
This was seen in the peaceful close of the invasion by Duke Robert,
as with that of Duke Henry half a century later. The question, in
short, that arose in 1066, when a Duke of the Normans asked his
barons to make him King of the English, arose once more in the
days of his son, when a King of the English asked his barons to make
him Duke of the Normans.</p>

<p>It was here no question of 'the laws and rights of Englishmen':<a id="footnotetagod35" name="footnotetagod35"></a><a href="#footnoteod35"><sup>35</sup></a>
it was to no folkmoot that William Rufus spoke. When we read of
the King in his court, composed of his tenants-in-chief,<a id="footnotetagod36" name="footnotetagod36"></a><a href="#footnoteod36"><sup>36</sup></a>
as surrounded by 'no small part of the nation',<a id="footnotetagod37" name="footnotetagod37"></a><a href="#footnoteod37"><sup>37</sup></a>
when we hear of the mass
of 'the Assembly ... crying Yea, yea';<a id="footnotetagod38" name="footnotetagod38"></a><a href="#footnoteod38"><sup>38</sup></a>
when we learn that 'a great numerical proportion, most likely a numerical majority, were
natives',<a id="footnotetagod39" name="footnotetagod39"></a><a href="#footnoteod39"><sup>39</sup></a>
we are fairly prepared for the astounding statement that:</p>

<blockquote><p>
The wide fields which had seen the great review and the great homage
in the days of the elder William, could alone hold the crowd which came
together to share in the great court of doom which was holden by the
younger.<a id="footnotetagod40" name="footnotetagod40"></a><a href="#footnoteod40"><sup>40</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>For we see that in all these fantasies of a brain viewing plain facts
through a mist of moots and 'witan', we have what can only be
termed history in masquerade.</p>

<h3>RICHARD THE FIRST'S CHANGE OF SEAL (1198)</h3><!-- rs -->

<blockquote><p>
With the superficial student and the empiric politician, it is too common
to relegate the investigation of such changes to the domain of arch&aelig;ology. I
shall not attempt to rebut the imputation; only, if such things are arch&aelig;ology,
then arch&aelig;ology is history.&mdash;<span class="sc">Stubbs</span>, Preface to <cite>R. Hoveden</cite>, IV, lxxx.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Historical research is about to pass, if indeed it is not already
passing, into a new sphere&mdash;the sphere of Arch&aelig;ology. The central
idea of that great advance which the present generation has witnessed
in the domain of history has been the rebuilding of the historical
fabric on the relatively sure foundation of original and contemporary
authorities, studied in the purest texts. Chronicles,
however, are not inexhaustible: for many periods they are all too
few. The reaper has almost done his work; the turn of the gleaner has
come. The smaller <i>quellen</i> of history have now to be diligently
examined and made to yield those fragments of information which
will supplement, often where most needed, our existing stock of
knowledge.</p>

<p>But this is not our only gain as we leave the broad highways
trodden by so many before us. Those precious fragments which are
to form our spoils will enable us to do more than supplement the
statements of our standard chroniclers: they will afford the means of
checking, of testing, by independent evidence, these statements, of
submitting our witnesses to a cross-examination which may shake
their testimony and their credit in a most unexpected manner.</p>

<p>As an instance of the results to be attained by arch&aelig;ological research,
I have selected Richard the First's celebrated change of seal.
Interesting as being the occasion on which the three lions first appear
as the Royal arms of England&mdash;arms unchanged to the present day&mdash;it
possesses exceptional historical importance from the circumstances
by which it was accompanied, and which led, admittedly,
to its adoption.</p>

<p>Historians have agreed, without the least hesitation, to refer this
event to the year 1194, and to place it subsequent to the truce of
Tilli&egrave;res or about the beginning of August. 'That Richard I,' writes
a veteran student,<a id="footnotetagrs1" name="footnotetagrs1"></a><a href="#footnoters1"><sup>1</sup></a>
'adopted a new seal upon his return from the
Holy Land is a matter of notoriety.' Speed, in fact, had shown the
way. We are told by him that 'the king caused [1194] a new broad
seale to be made, requiring that all charters granted under his
former seale should be confirmed under this, whereby he drew a
great masse of money to his treasurie'.<a id="footnotetagrs2" name="footnotetagrs2"></a><a href="#footnoters2"><sup>2</sup></a>
The Bishop of Oxford,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page407" id="page407"></a>[pg 407]</span>
with his wonted accuracy, faithfully reproduces the statement of
Hoveden (the original and sole authority we shall find for the story),
telling us that 'Amongst other oppressive acts he [Richard] took the
seal from his unscrupulous but faithful chancellor, and, having
ordered a new one to be made, proclaimed the nullity of all charters
which had been sealed with the old one.'<a id="footnotetagrs3" name="footnotetagrs3"></a><a href="#footnoters3"><sup>3</sup></a>
Mr Freeman similarly places the episode just before 'the licenses for the tournaments'
(August 20, 1194), and consistently refers to Dr Stubbs's history.<a id="footnotetagrs4" name="footnotetagrs4"></a><a href="#footnoters4"><sup>4</sup></a>
Miss Norgate, in her valuable work, our latest authority on the
period, assigns the event to the same date, and tells us that 'Rog.
Hoveden's very confused account of the seals is made clear by Bishop
Stubbs'.<a id="footnotetagrs5" name="footnotetagrs5"></a><a href="#footnoters5"><sup>5</sup></a>
Mr Maitland, in his noble edition of 'Bracton's Note-book',
gives a case (ii. 69) in which a charter sealed 'secundo sigillo Regis
Ricardi' was actually produced in court (1219), and explains that
'Richard had a new seal made in 1194', referring to Hoveden for his
authority.<a id="footnotetagrs6" name="footnotetagrs6"></a><a href="#footnoters6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>It should be observed that all these writers rely merely on Hoveden,
none of them throwing any light on the process of confirmation,
or telling us how it was effected, and whether any traces of it remain.
An independent writer, M. Boivin-Champeaux, in his monograph
on William Longchamp, discusses the episode at some length,
and asserts that the repudiated documents were 'assujettis, pour leur
revalidation, &agrave; une nouvelle et co&ucirc;teuse scellure'. Like the others,
however, he relies on the authority of Hoveden, and consequently
repeats the same date.</p>

<p>In the course of examining some ancient charters, I recognized
one of them as nothing less than an actual instance of a confirmation
consequent on this change of seal. But its incomprehensible feature
was that the charter was confirmed on August 22, 1198, having
originally been granted, 'sub primo sigillo', so recently as January
7th preceding. How could this be possible if the great seal had been
changed so early as August 1194, and if the first seal, as stated by
Dr Stubbs, was 'broken' on that occasion? Careful and prolonged
research among the charters of the period (both in the original and
in transcripts) has enabled me to answer the question, and to prove
that (as, of course, the above charter implies) the change of seal did
not take place in 1194, but 1198, and between January and May of
that year.</p>

<p>Original charters under the second seal, confirming grants under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page408" id="page408"></a>[pg 408]</span>
the first, are distinctly rare. I have found, as yet, but one in the
Public Record Office, and only two at the British Museum. But of
originals and transcripts together I have noted twenty-eight. The
dates of the original grants range from September 5, 1189, to January
7, 1198 (1197-8), and of the confirmations from May 27, 1198,
to April 5, 1199.<a id="footnotetagrs7" name="footnotetagrs7"></a><a href="#footnoters7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>In a single instance there is fortunately preserved not only the
text of the confirmation charter, but also that of the original grant.<a id="footnotetagrs8" name="footnotetagrs8"></a><a href="#footnoters8"><sup>8</sup></a>
From this we learn that the charter of confirmation did not necessarily
give the wording, but only the gist ('tenor') of the original
grant. We are thus brought to the instructive formula invariably
used in these charters:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Is erat tenor carte nostre in primo sigillo nostro. Quod quia aliquando
perditum fuit, et, dum capti essemus in alem[anni&acirc;], in aliena potestate
constitutum, mutatum est. Huius autem innovationis testes sunt Hii, etc.,
etc.
</p></blockquote>

<p>We may here turn to the passage in Hoveden [ed. Stubbs, iii. 267]
on which historians have relied, and see how far the reasons for the
change given in the charters themselves correspond with those
alleged by the chronicler.</p>

<blockquote><p>
Fecit sibi novum sigillum fieri, et mandavit, per singulas terras suas, quod
nihil ratum foret quod fuerat per vetus sigillum suum; tum quia cancellarius
ille operatus fuerat inde minus discrete quam esset necesse, tum quia sigillum
illud perditum erat, quando Rogerus Malus Catulus, vicecancellarius suus,
submersus erat in mari ante insulam de Cipro, et pr&aelig;cepit rex quod omnes
qui cartas habebant venirent ad novum sigillum ad cartas suas renovandas.
</p></blockquote>

<p>In both cases we find there are two reasons given; but while one
of these is the same in both, namely the temporary loss of the seal
when Roger Malchael was drowned, the other is wholly and essentially
different. The whole aspect of the transaction is thus altered. To
illustrate this I shall now place side by side the independent glosses
of the Bishop of Oxford and of M. Boivin-Champeaux:</p>

<table class="diff1" summary="comparison" border="0">
<tr>
       <td class="w2">
Richard's first seal was lost when
the vice-chancellor was drowned
between Rhodes and Cyprus in 1190;
but it was recovered with his dead
body. The seal that was now broken
must have been the one which the
chancellor had used during the
king's absence. Richard, however,

his seal to be set to various grants for
which he took money, but which he
never intended to confirm. Therefore
probably he found it convenient
now to have a new seal in lieu of both
the former ones, although he threw
the blame of the transactions annulled
upon the chancellor. The importance
of the seal is already very great.

<p>Thus both writers assume that there were two seals, one which
remained in England with the chancellor, and one which accompanied
the king to the east. They further (though Dr Stubbs is somewhat
obscure) hold that the two excuses given refer respectively to
the two seals, thus discrediting both. But when we turn to the charters
themselves, we find but one seal mentioned, and to that one seal
alone both the excuses refer. The king explains that on two occasions
it was, so to speak, 'out on the loose'&mdash;(1) when his vice-chancellor
was drowned; (2) when he himself was captured in Germany.
This was, of course, the seal which accompanied him to the
east.<a id="footnotetagrs9" name="footnotetagrs9"></a><a href="#footnoters9"><sup>9</sup></a>
The king makes no allusion to any other or to the chancellor.
Such charters and grants as are known to us all proceed from the
king himself, either before he left Messina or after he had reached
Germany on his return. No charter or grant of Longchamp, as
representing him, is known. In short, the whole of our record evidence
points one way: the charters which the king proclaimed must
be confirmed, and which we find brought to him for that purpose
were those which he had himself granted, and no other. Lastly, even
had we nothing before us but the passage in Hoveden which all have
followed, I contend that it may, and indeed ought to be, read as
referring to a single seal. But it is, as Miss Norgate justly observes,
'very confused', from its allusion to the chancellor's use of the seal.
That allusion, however, would most naturally refer to the truce of
Tilli&egrave;res, and not to the use of a separate seal in England. Therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page410" id="page410"></a>[pg 410]</span>
even if we accepted, which I do not, Hoveden's statement, it would
not warrant the inference that has been drawn.</p>

<p>Again, when Miss Norgate writes of the 'withdrawal of the seal
from William', and when Dr Stubbs tells us that the king 'took the
seal from' him, these statements may have two meanings. But M.
Boivin-Champeaux is more precise: 'L'emploi de ces proc&eacute;d&eacute;s
emportait le m&eacute;pris et la violation non seulement de tous les actes
&eacute;trangers au chancelier, mais encore de tous ceux o&ugrave; il avait mis la
main. Il ne pouvait d&eacute;cemment conserver les sceaux. Le roi les lui
enleva.' This is a distinct assertion that Longchamp was deprived
of his office. Yet all our evidence points to the conclusion that he
remained chancellor to the day of his death.</p>

<p>Dismissing Hoveden for the time, and returning to the testimony
of the charters, we have seen that they point to the event we are
discussing having taken place in 1198, between January 7, at
which date the first seal was still in use, and May 27, when charters
were already being brought for confirmation under the second seal.
Passing now from the charters to the seals still in existence, we learn
from Mr Wyon's magnificent work<a id="footnotetagrs10" name="footnotetagrs10"></a><a href="#footnoters10"><sup>10</sup></a>
(which has appeared since I
completed my own investigation) that the first seal was still in use
on April 1, 1198,<a id="footnotetagrs11" name="footnotetagrs11"></a><a href="#footnoters11"><sup>11</sup></a>
while an impression of the second is found as
early as May 22, 1198.<a id="footnotetagrs12" name="footnotetagrs12"></a><a href="#footnoters12"><sup>12</sup></a>
 Thus our limit of time for the change is
narrowed to April 1-May 22, 1198.<a id="footnotetagrs13" name="footnotetagrs13"></a><a href="#footnoters13"><sup>13</sup></a>
The evidence of the charters
and of the seals being thus in perfect harmony, let us see whether
this limit of date corresponds with a time of financial difficulty. For,
so desperate a device as that of the king's repudiation of his charters
would only have been resorted to at a time of extreme pressure. What
do we find? We find that the time of this change of seal corresponds
with the great financial crisis of Richard's reign. The Church had at
length lost patience, and had actually in the Council at Oxford
(December 1197) raised a protest. The 'want of money', in Miss
Norgate's words, was 'a difficulty which ... must have seemed well-nigh
insurmountable'. Preparations were being made for a huge levy
at five shillings on every ploughland. It was at this moment that the
desperate king repudiated all the charters he had granted throughout
his reign, and proclaimed that they must be 'brought to him for
confirmation; in other words ... paid for a second time'.<a id="footnotetagrs14" name="footnotetagrs14"></a><a href="#footnoters14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page411" id="page411"></a>[pg 411]</span></p>

<p>Let us now look at the other chroniclers. R. Coggeshall is independent
and precise:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Accessit autem ad totius mali cumulum, juxta vit&aelig; ejus terminum, prioris
sigilli sui renovatio, quo exiit edictum per totum ejus regnum ut omnes
cart&aelig;, confirmationes, ac privilegiat&aelig; libertates qu&aelig; prioris sigilli impressione
roboraverat, irrita forent nec alicujus libertatis vigorem obtinerent, nisi
posteriori sigillo roborarentur. In quibus renovandis et iterum comparandis
innumerabilis pecunia congesta est (p. 93).
</p></blockquote>

<p>This is in complete accordance with the now ascertained fact
that Richard changed his seal, and regranted the old charters,
within the last year of his life. Similarly independent and precise
evidence is afforded by the Annals of Waverley:</p>

<blockquote><p>
<span class="sc">mcxcviii</span>. Anno <span class="sc">x.</span> regis Ricardi pr&aelig;cepit idem rex omnes cartas in regno
suo emptas reformari, et novo sigilli sui impressione roborari, vel omnes
cassari, cujuscunque dignitatis aut ordinis essent, qui vellent sua protectione
defensari, vel universa bona sua confiscari.<a id="footnotetagrs15" name="footnotetagrs15"></a><a href="#footnoters15"><sup>15</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Further, we read in the Annals of Worcester<a id="footnotetagrs16" name="footnotetagrs16"></a><a href="#footnoters16"><sup>16</sup></a>
and in the <cite>Historia Major</cite> of M. Paris (ii. 450-451)<a id="footnotetagrs17" name="footnotetagrs17"></a><a href="#footnoters17"><sup>17</sup></a>
that in 1198, 'circaque festum sancti Michaelis, mutat&aelig; sunt carte quas prius fecerat rex Ricardus, novo
sigillo suo'. Now this Michaelmas fell just in the heart of the period
within which the process of confirmation is proved to have been
going on.</p>

<p>We see, then, that the evidence (1) of the seals, (2) of the charters,
(3) of the circumstances of the time, (4) of other chroniclers, all
concur in pointing to the spring of 1198. And now we will lastly
appeal to Hoveden against himself. After telling us of the king's
proclamation on the refusal of the religious to contribute to the
carucage in the spring of 1198, he adds:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Pr&aelig;terea pr&aelig;cepit idem rex ut omnes, tam clerici quam laici, qui cartas
sive confirmationes habebant de sigillo suo veteri deferrent eas ad sigillum
suum novum renovandas, et nisi fecerint, nihil quod actum fuerat per sigillum
suum vetus ratum haberetur (iv. 66).
</p></blockquote>

<p>This passage, which ought to be compared with Coggeshall, is
merely ignored by Dr Stubbs. Miss Norgate, however, boldly explains
it as 'a renewal of the decree requiring all charters granted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page412" id="page412"></a>[pg 412]</span>
under the king's old seal to be brought up for confirmation under
the new one' (ii. 356). But the passage stands by itself, as describing
a new measure.<a id="footnotetagrs18" name="footnotetagrs18"></a><a href="#footnoters18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p>The only conclusion to be drawn from this cumulative evidence
is that the earlier passage in Hoveden (1194) which has been so
universally accepted, must be rejected altogether. Against the facts
I have adduced it cannot stand.</p>

<p>Incredible though it may seem that a court official, a chronicler
so able and well informed, indeed, in the words of his editor, 'our
primary authority for the period',<a id="footnotetagrs19" name="footnotetagrs19"></a><a href="#footnoters19"><sup>19</sup></a>
should have misstated so grossly
an event, as it were, under his own eyes, we must remember that
'Hoveden's personality is to a certain degree vindicated by a sort of
carelessness about exact dates'.<a id="footnotetagrs20" name="footnotetagrs20"></a><a href="#footnoters20"><sup>20</sup></a>
Yet even so, 'few are the points',
our supreme authority assures us, 'in which a very close examination
and collation with contemporary authors can detect chronological
error in Hoveden'.<a id="footnotetagrs21" name="footnotetagrs21"></a><a href="#footnoters21"><sup>21</sup></a>
Nor, of the eight anachronisms laboriously
established by Dr Stubbs, does any one approach in magnitude the
error I have here exposed. The importance of every anachronism in
its bearing on the authorship of the chronicle is by him clearly
explained.</p>

<p>How far does the rejection of this statement on the change of seal
affect the statement which precedes it as to the Truce of Tilli&egrave;res?
Hoveden places the latter and the former in the relation of cause and
effect:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Deinde veniens in Normanniam moleste tulit quicquid factum fuerat de
supradictis treugis, et imputans cancellario suo hoc per eum fuisse factum,
abstulit ab eo sigillum suum, et fecit, etc. (iii. 267).
</p></blockquote>

<p>This is rendered by Dr Stubbs in the margin: 'He annuls the
truce and all the acts of the chancellor passed under the old seal.'
The passage has also been so read by M. Boivin-Champeaux (p.
221); but if that is the meaning, which I think is by no means
certain, Hoveden contradicts himself. For he speaks five months
later of the truce ('Treuga qu&aelig; inter eos statuta fuerat duratura
usque ad festum omnium sanctorum') as not having stopped
private raids on either side.<a id="footnotetagrs22" name="footnotetagrs22"></a><a href="#footnoters22"><sup>22</sup></a>
R. de Diceto, mentioning the truce (ii. 120), says nothing of it being annulled, nor does R. Newburgh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page413" id="page413"></a>[pg 413]</span>
in his careful account. On the contrary, he implies that it
held good, though the terms were thought dishonourable to Richard
(ii. 420). I should, therefore, read Hoveden as stating simply that
Richard was much annoyed at ('moleste tulit') its terms, and was
wroth with the chancellor for accepting them.</p>

<p>In addition to correcting the received date for Richard the First's
change of seal, the evidence I have collected enables us, for the
first time, to learn how and to what extent the confirmation of the
charters was effected. We find that it was no sweeping process,
carried out on a single occasion, but that it was gradually and
slowly proceeding during the last eleven months of the king's life.
Here, then, is the explanation of another fact (also hitherto overlooked),
namely that only a minority of the charters were ever confirmed
under the second seal.<a id="footnotetagrs23" name="footnotetagrs23"></a><a href="#footnoters23"><sup>23</sup></a>
For the king's death abruptly stopped the operation of that oppressive decree which was
being so reluctantly obeyed.</p>

<p>It should be superfluous for me to add that, in thus correcting
previous statements, I have not impeached the accuracy of our
greatest living historian, who could only form his judgment from
the evidence before him. The result of my researches has been to
show that the evidence itself breaks down when submitted to the
test of fact.</p>

<h3>COMMUNAL HOUSE DEMOLITION</h3><!-- ch -->

<p>There was a strange custom peculiar to the ancient community of the
Cinque Ports, which has not, so far as I know, been found elsewhere
in England. If a member of any one of these towns was elected
to serve as Mayor or 'Jurat' (the governing bodies consisting of a
Mayor and twelve 'Jurats'), and refused to accept the office, his
house was publicly demolished by the community. An extract from
the Custumal of Sandwich, headed 'Pena maioris electi recusantis
officium suum', will make the custom clear:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Si maior sic electus officium suum recipere noluit, primo et secundo et
tercio monitus, tota communitas ibit ad capitale messuagium suum, si
habuerit proprium, et illud cum armis omnimodo quo poterit prosternat
usque ad terram.... Similiter quicunque juratus fuerit electus, et jurare
noluerit, simile judicium.<a id="footnotetagch1" name="footnotetagch1"></a><a href="#footnotech1"><sup>1</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Although the custom of house demolition is apparently, as I have
said, peculiar in England to the Cinque Ports, it was of widespread
occurrence abroad. Thither, therefore, we must turn our steps in
order to investigate its history.</p>

<p>It is in Flanders and in Northern France, and in Picardy, most of
all, that we find this singular custom prevailing, and discover its
inseparable connection with the institution of the <i>Commune</i>. It would
seem that the penalty of house demolition was originally decreed
for offences against the <i>commune</i> in its corporate capacity. Thierry,
basing his conclusions mainly on the charters of the <i>commune</i> of
Amiens and the daughter-charter of Abbeville writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Celui qui se soustrait &agrave; la justice de la Commune est puni de banissement,
et sa maison est abattue. Celui qui tient des propos injurieux contre la Commune
encourt la m&ecirc;me peine. Voil&agrave; pour les dispositions communes aux
chartes d'Amiens et d'Abbeville, c'est-&agrave;-dire pour celles qui authentiquement
sont plus anciennes que l'acte royal de 1190. Si l'on ne s'y arr&ecirc;te pas et
qu'on rel&egrave;ve dans cet acte d'autres dispositions, probablement primitives
aussi, on trouvera les peines du crime politique, <i>l'abatis de maison</i> et le banissement,
appliqu&eacute;es &agrave; celui qui viole sciemment les constitutions de la Commune
et &agrave; celui qui, bless&eacute; dans une querelle, refuse la composition en
justice et refuse pareillement de donner s&eacute;curit&eacute; &agrave; son adversaire.</p>

<p>Une peine moindre, car elle se r&eacute;duit &agrave; ce que la maison du d&eacute;linquant
soit abattue s'il n'aime mieux en payer la valeur, est appliqu&eacute;e &agrave; celui qui
addresse des injures au Maire dans l'exercice de ses fonctions, et &agrave; celui qui
frappe un de ses Jur&eacute;s devant les magistrats, en pleine audience. Ainsi
l'abatis de maison, vengeance de la Commune l&eacute;s&eacute;e ou offens&eacute;e, &eacute;tait &agrave; la
fois un ch&acirc;timent par lui-m&ecirc;me et le signe qui rendait plus terrible aux
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page417" id="page417"></a>[pg 417]</span>
imaginations la sentence de banissement conditionnel ou absolu. Il avait
lieu dans la plupart ... des communes du nord de la France avec un appareil
sombre et imposant; en pr&eacute;sence des citoyens, convoqu&eacute;s &agrave; son de cloche, le
Maire frappait un coup de marteau contre la demeure du condamn&eacute;, et des
ouvriers, requis pour service public, proc&eacute;daient &agrave; la d&eacute;molition qu'ils
poursuivaient jusqu'&agrave; ce qu'il ne rest&acirc;t plus pierre sur pierre.<a id="footnotetagch2" name="footnotetagch2"></a><a href="#footnotech2"><sup>2</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>The public character of the ceremony, which was no less marked
at Sandwich (<i>vide supra</i>), is well illustrated in the <cite>Ordonnances</cite> of
Philip of Alsace (<i>circ.</i> 1178) on the powers of his <i>baillis</i> in Flanders:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Domus diruenda Judicio Scabinorum, post quindenam a scabinis indultam,
quandocunque comes pr&aelig;ceperit, aut ballivus ejus, diruetur a communia
vill&aelig;, campana pulsata per Scabinos; et qui ad diruendam illam non
venerit, in forisfacto erit, etc., etc.
</p></blockquote>

<p>This ringing of the communal bell&mdash;parallel to the moot-bell of
England&mdash;is an important feature in the matter. Without insisting
upon a stray allusion, one may ask whether an entry in the Colchester
records in the sixteenth century, threatening that if an offending
burgess does not make amends, the town will 'ring him out of his
freedom', may not be explained by this practice.</p>

<p>There are plenty of other early instances of this house demolition
in recognized <i>Communes</i>. At Bruges we read (<i>circ.</i> 1190): 'Si scabini
voluerint domum eius prosternere, poterunt', etc., etc. So, too, at
Roye, the charter (<i>circ.</i> 1183) provides: 'Domus forisfactoris diruetur
si Major voluerit, et si Major redempcionem accipiet de domibus
diruendis', etc., etc.... 'Si quis extraneus ... forisfactum fecerit ...
Major et homines ville ad diruendam domum ejus exeant; qu&aelig;
si sit adeo fortis ut vi Burgensium dirui non possit, ad eam diruendam
vim et auxilium conferemus'.<a id="footnotetagch3" name="footnotetagch3"></a><a href="#footnotech3"><sup>3</sup></a>
So essential was the power of distraint,
as we might term it, given to the community over its members, by
the possession of a house, that it was sometimes made compulsory
on a new member to become possessed of a house within a year of his
joining. This was the case at Laon, one of the oldest of the <i>Communes</i>,
the charter of Louis VI (1128) providing that 'Quicunque autem in
Pace ista recipiatur, infra anni spatium aut domum sibi edificet,
aut vineas emet ... per que justiciari possit, si quid forte in eum
querele evenerit'. Where, in the absence of such provision, the culprit
had no house to be demolished, it would seem that, in some cases, he
had to procure one, for the express purpose of being demolished,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page418" id="page418"></a>[pg 418]</span>
before he could be restored to his membership. Thus, at Abbeville,
the charter of <i>Commune</i> provides that 'si domum non habuerit, antequam
villam intret, domum centum solidorum, quam communia
prosternat, inveniet'.</p>

<p>Thierry pointed out how the 'commune' of north-eastern France
found its way, through its adoption in Normandy, to the opposite
corner of the country 'sur les terres de la domination Anglaise'.<a id="footnotetagch4" name="footnotetagch4"></a><a href="#footnotech4"><sup>4</sup></a>
The form 'jurats' adopted by the Cinque Ports for the members of
their governing body suggests, indeed, some connection with
Gascony, to which region, as Thierry observed, it more especially
belongs.<a id="footnotetagch5" name="footnotetagch5"></a><a href="#footnotech5"><sup>5</sup></a>
I was much struck, when visiting Bayonne, with its
interesting municipal history. Thierry alludes to its peculiar
character;<a id="footnotetagch6" name="footnotetagch6"></a><a href="#footnotech6"><sup>6</sup></a>
and, as the town had commercial relations with the
Cinque Ports, and illustrates, moreover, the tendency of a commercial
port to adopt, from other regions, a constitution peculiar
to itself, I shall here give from its local customs the provisions as to
house demolition.</p>

<p>Appended to John's charter granting a <i>communa</i> to Bayonne
(April 19, 1215) we find a code of communal ordinances based
partly on those in the Rouen and Falaise charters and partly on
the customs of La Rochelle. In this code the penalty of destroying
the offender's house was decreed for a magistrate who accepted
bribes,<a id="footnotetagch7" name="footnotetagch7"></a><a href="#footnotech7"><sup>7</sup></a>
for a citizen who shirked his military service,<a id="footnotetagch8" name="footnotetagch8"></a><a href="#footnotech8"><sup>8</sup></a>
for a perjured man,<a id="footnotetagch9" name="footnotetagch9"></a><a href="#footnotech9"><sup>9</sup></a>
for a thief.<a id="footnotetagch10" name="footnotetagch10"></a><a href="#footnotech10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>It again appears as the penalty for receiving bribes in the local
Custumal assigned to 1273: 'La soe maison sera darrocade, et
que jameis ed ni son her no hage juridiccion en le communi.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page419" id="page419"></a>[pg 419]</span>
In the foundation-charter granted to Sanabria by Alphonso IX of
Leon, in 1220, we find this penalty similarly assigned to perjury
('que la su casa sea derribada por esta razon'); but when the
charter was altered by Alphonso X (September 1, 1258), the
penalty was commuted for a pecuniary fine of sixty 'sueldos', on the
ground that the destruction of the house was an injury to the city
and to himself.<a id="footnotetagch11" name="footnotetagch11"></a><a href="#footnotech11"><sup>11</sup></a>
This is important as affording an instance of the
actual introduction of commutation.</p>

<p>Now, my contention is that, as the practice of communal house
demolition wandered down into Gascony, and thence actually
crossed the Pyrenees into Spain, so&mdash;in the opposite direction&mdash;it
crossed the channel and established itself in the Cinque Ports.
As these movements become better understood, we are learning to
treat them scientifically, and to trace them through their growth
to their origin. In the case of the <i>commune</i>, the principle of filiation
enables us to accomplish this with remarkable success.</p>

<p>But, it may be asked, is there any instance, on the other side of the
channel, of house demolition being the penalty prescribed for
refusal to accept office as Mayor or Jurat? It is, I reply, at Amiens
the very penalty prescribed for that offence! The Custumal of
Amiens contained these two clauses:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Et convient que chis qui pris est faiche le serment de le mairie; et se il ne
veult faire, on abatera se maison, et demourra en le merchy du roy au
jugement de esquevins.</p>

<p>Derekief se li maires qui eslus seroit refusoit le mairie et vausist souffrir le
damage, j&agrave; pour che ne demouerroit qu'il ne fesist l'office; et se aucuns
refusoit l'esquevinage, on abateroit sa maison et l'amenderoit au jugement
de esquevins, et pour chou ne demoureroit mie que il ne fesist l'office de
l'esquevinage.<a id="footnotetagch12" name="footnotetagch12"></a><a href="#footnotech12"><sup>12</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Thierry, who was ignorant of the Cinque Ports custom&mdash;as the
historians of the Cinque Ports appear to have been ignorant of that
at Amiens&mdash;describes this provision as 'loi remarquable en ce
qu'elle faisait revivre et sanctionnait par des garanties toutes
nouvelles ce principe de la l&eacute;gislation romaine, que les offices
municipaux sont une charge obligatoire'.<a id="footnotetagch13" name="footnotetagch13"></a><a href="#footnotech13"><sup>13</sup></a>
But this brings us face to face with the difficult and disputed question of the persistence of
Roman institutions. Personally, I have always thought it rash to
accept similarity as proof of continuity. Here, for instance, the
occurrence of this practice at Sandwich might lead to the inference
that the institutions of Sandwich were of direct Roman origin. Yet,
if this practice was imported from France, we see how erroneous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page420" id="page420"></a>[pg 420]</span>
that inference would be. A <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of this rash argument,
as I have elsewhere pointed out, would be found in the suggestion
that every modern borough rejoicing in the possession of aldermen
had derived its institutions continuously from Anglo-Saxon times.
In the particular instance of this practice, we should note that it
occurs (<i>a</i>) in that portion of France where the municipal development
was least Roman in character; (<i>b</i>) in a peculiar and original
form&mdash;the 'garanties toutes nouvelles' of Thierry.</p>

<p>Again, we find the infliction of fines for non-acceptance of
municipal office a familiar custom in England even to the present
day. These fines were undoubtedly commutations for an original
expulsion from the community; and at Colchester, for example,
we have a case of a man being deprived of 'his freedom' for declining
the office of alderman, and of his having to make 'submission'
and pay a fine before it was restored. The fact is, that in every
community, whether urban or rural, where office was a necessary
but burdensome duty&mdash;like modern jury-service or mediaeval
'suit'&mdash;a penalty had to be imposed upon those who declined to
discharge it. The peculiarity of the Sandwich and Amiens cases
consists not in the imposition of a penalty, but in the character of the
penalty imposed.</p>

<p>Pass we now from the consideration of this penalty to the wider
and important conclusions suggested by its local occurrence.</p>

<p>I have always been puzzled by the peculiar phenomena presented
by the 'Cinque Ports' organization. To other writers it would
seem to present no such difficulty; but to me it is unique in England,
and inexplicable on English lines. In that able monograph of Professor
Burrows,<a id="footnotetagch13a" name="footnotetagch13a"></a><a href="#footnotech13a"><sup>13</sup></a>
which is the latest contribution on the subject, the
writer, I venture to think, leaves the problem as obscure as ever.
I shall now, therefore, advance the suggestion, which has long been
taking form in my mind, that the 'Cinque Ports' corporation was of
foreign origin, and was an offshoot of the communal movement in
Northern France.</p>

<p>From Picardy, which faced the Cinque Ports, they derived, I
believe, their confederation. To quote Thierry:</p>

<blockquote><p>
La r&eacute;gion du nord, qui est le berceau, et pour ainsi dire la terre classique
des communes jur&eacute;es, comprend la Picardie, l'Artois, etc.... Parmi ces
provinces, la Picardie est celle qui renferme le plus grand nombre de communes
proprement dites, o&ugrave; cette forme de r&eacute;gime atteint le plus haut degr&eacute;
d'ind&eacute;pendance et o&ugrave; dans ses applications, elle offre le plus de vari&eacute;t&eacute;. Les
communes de Picardie avaient en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral toute justice, haute, moyenne et
basse. Nonseulement dans cette province les chartes municipales des villes se
trouvaient appliqu&eacute;es &agrave; de simples villages, dont quelques-uns n'existent
plus, mais encore <i>il y avait des conf&eacute;d&eacute;rations de plusieurs villages ou hameaux r&eacute;unis
en municipalit&eacute;s sous une charte et une magistrature collectives</i>.<a id="footnotetagch14" name="footnotetagch14"></a><a href="#footnotech14"><sup>14</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page421" id="page421"></a>[pg 421]</span></p>

<p>Let me briefly summarize the arguments on which I base my
hypothesis:</p>

<ul class="none">

<li>(1) There is no parallel to the Cinque Ports confederation in
England,<a id="footnotetagch15" name="footnotetagch15"></a><a href="#footnotech15"><sup>15</sup></a>
but there is in Picardy.</li>

<li>(2) The very name 'Cinque Ports' betrays a foreign origin,<a id="footnotetagch16" name="footnotetagch16"></a><a href="#footnotech16"><sup>16</sup></a>
as does the fact that the oath taken by the King's Warden to the
Corporation was termed, not an oath, but a 'serement' (as in
France).</li>

<li>(3) The English Merchant-Guild<a id="footnotetagch17" name="footnotetagch17"></a><a href="#footnotech17"><sup>17</sup></a>
and the English 'Alderman'<a id="footnotetagch18" name="footnotetagch18"></a><a href="#footnotech18"><sup>18</sup></a>
were unknown to the Cinque Ports constitutions; but they all
possessed the typical constitution of the <i>communes</i> of Northern
France, namely a Mayor, with a Council of twelve, these twelve
councillors having the French name of <i>Jurats</i>.<a id="footnotetagch19" name="footnotetagch19"></a><a href="#footnotech19"><sup>19</sup></a></li>

<li>(4) In the Cinque Ports, as in the French <i>Communes</i>, we find side
by side with this elective administration, a royal officer, with us a
Warden, with them the <i>S&eacute;n&eacute;chal</i> (or <i>Pr&eacute;v&ocirc;t</i> or <i>Bailli</i>) <i>du Roi</i>.</li>

<li>(5) The very same penalty of house demolition for refusal to
accept office as Mayor or Jurat was exacted in the Cinque Ports
(and nowhere else in England) as at Amiens.</li>
</ul>

<p>I do not contend that the French 'commune' was adopted intact
by the Cinque Ports, for, of course, it was not so. In the matter of
names alone, they are not styled a 'commune', nor are the members
of their community termed 'jur&eacute;s' (<i>jurati</i>), but 'barons' (<i>barones</i>).
The study, however, of the 'commune' in France itself reveals the
adaptation to environment it underwent on transplantation. And,
the salient feature of the Cinque Ports organization, the fact that
they formed a single community, possessing a single assembly,
and receiving a joint charter, is paralleled most remarkably in the
joint 'communes' of Picardy, containing from four to eight separate
'Vills'.<a id="footnotetagch20" name="footnotetagch20"></a><a href="#footnotech20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>It would be very satisfactory if the French 'communes' could
throw light on the obscure title of 'barons' appertaining to the men
of the Cinque Ports, and to them, I maintain (against Professor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page422" id="page422"></a>[pg 422]</span>
Burrows), alone among English burgesses. I have elsewhere shown
that there is evidence of the use of this term at an earlier period
than is supposed, viz., in the early years of Stephen;<a id="footnotetagch21" name="footnotetagch21"></a><a href="#footnotech21"><sup>21</sup></a>
but on its origin the 'commune' throws no light. One can only quote the
parallel afforded by the 'commune' of Niort, and this is taken from a
late document (1579). Its officers are said to hold of the King '&agrave;
droit de baronie, &agrave; foi et homage-lige, au devoir d'un gant ou cinq
sols tournois, pour tous devoirs, payables &agrave; chaque mutation de
seigneur'.<a id="footnotetagch22" name="footnotetagch22"></a><a href="#footnotech22"><sup>22</sup></a>
This 'devoir' is parallel, it will be seen, to the 'canopy-service'
(or 'Honours at Court') of the Cinque Ports, rendered as
it was, in practice, '&agrave; chaque mutation de seigneur'. It is noteworthy
that a French royal charter of 1196 contains the clause:
'prefati quatuor ville exercitum et equitationem novis debent <i>sicut
alie communie nostre</i>';<a id="footnotetagch23" name="footnotetagch23"></a><a href="#footnotech23"><sup>23</sup></a>
but one can scarcely connect this with the
naval service of the Cinque Ports. Yet it was part, undoubtedly, of
the communal principle that the 'commune' should hold directly
of the King, and not of any mediate lord, and this principle would
explain the style 'barones regis' applied to the men of the Cinque
Ports.</p>

<p>To sum up, there are features about the Cinque Ports organization
which can only be accounted for, it seems to me, by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page423" id="page423"></a>[pg 423]</span>
hypothesis here advanced. If this novel solution be accepted,<a id="footnotetagch24" name="footnotetagch24"></a><a href="#footnotech24"><sup>24</sup></a>
a question at once arises as to the date at which this communal
confederacy was established. From what we know of the origin of the
'commune', we can scarcely believe in its adoption here till a
generation, at least, after the Conquest. 'Only the least informed
and most sceptical,' writes Professor Burrows, 'have placed the
act of incorporation later than the date of the Conqueror',<a id="footnotetagch25" name="footnotetagch25"></a><a href="#footnotech25"><sup>25</sup></a>
but a wider knowledge of municipal institutions would lead to the
opposite conclusion. It is possible that the reign of Henry I may have
witnessed the superimposing of a communal confederacy on the
existing institutions of the several ports; it is impossible, at any rate,
to trace it in Domesday, and difficult, indeed, to reconcile with its
existence the evidence afforded by the Great Survey. It is conceivable
that the position already attained, in the Conqueror's days, by
Dover, may have served as a model for the other Ports, when they
learnt the power of the principle that lay at the root of the <i>commune</i>&mdash;'L'union
fait la force'.<a id="footnotetagch26" name="footnotetagch26"></a><a href="#footnotech26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

The text must now be modified in the light of my further criticism, in the next
paper, of the early date alleged for the confederation of the Ports.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="footnotech21" name="footnotech21"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotetagch21"><sup>21</sup></a>
This was written in reliance on the statement by Mr Howlett (<cite>Chronicles of
the reigns of Stephen, Henry II and Richard I</cite>, vol. iii., p. xl) that an interesting writ he
quoted from 'the cartulary of St Benet-at-Hulme' was 'safely attributable to the
year 1137'. It is a writ of Robert, Earl of Leicester, acting as justiciary, and 'gives',
says Mr Howlett, 'a clear idea of the Earl's position at the opening of the reign'.
As he has made himself master of the period, and has specially studied its manuscript
sources, I accepted his assurance without question. But as it subsequently
struck me that such a writ was more likely to be issued by the Earl when justiciary
under Henry II, I referred to the cartulary and found that the writ contained the
words 'avi regis', proving it, of course, to belong to the reign, not of Stephen, but of
Henry II:</p>

<p class="footnote3c">'R. Com(es) leg(recestri&aelig;) Baronibus regis de Hastingg' salutem.
Precipio quod abbas et monachi de Hulmo teneant bene et in pace
et juste terras suas in Gernemut ... sicut eas melius tenuerunt
tempore Regis H. <i>avi regis</i> ... T. R. Basset per breve
regis de ultra mare' (Galba E. 2, fo. 33<i>b</i>).</p>

<p class="footnote">We can only, therefore, say of its date that it is previous to the Earl's death in
1168. In any case, however, it is of much interest as connecting Yarmouth with
Hastings alone, not, as alleged, with the Cinque Ports as a whole. This is in perfect
accordance with the fact that John's charter to Hastings in 1205 duly mentions
its rights at Yarmouth, of which there is no mention in his charters to the other
ports.</p>

<p class="footnote">I have noted in this same cartulary, and on the same page, an interesting confirmation
by Henry II to the Abbey of the land, 'quam lefwinus et Robertus
presbyteri et Bonefacius et ceteri barones mei de Hastingges eidem ecclesie
dederunt in Gernemut' apud Den ... Test' Thom' cancellario. Apud Westmonasterium'.
The name of Thomas fixes the date as not later than 1158. In the
charters of 1205, the people of Hastings are styled 'barons', but those of the other
ports only 'homines'.</p>

Professor Burrows is very severe on those who question the alleged charter of
Edward the Confessor to the Ports and 'the sweeping franchises' that it conferred
(pp. 55-6, 59). But the sole evidence for its alleged existence is the charter of 1278,
which does not even, I think, necessarily imply it. For the allusion to the liberties
the Ports possessed in the days of Edward and his successors might well be taken
from such a charter as that of Henry II to Lincoln, in which he grants to the citizens
all the liberties 'quas habuerunt tempore Edwardi et Willelmi et Henrici regum
Anglorum'. This does not imply that those kings had granted charters.</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<h3>THE CINQUE PORTS CHARTERS</h3><!-- cp -->

<p>I have allowed the preceding paper to stand as it was written, in
spite of the rejoinder by Professor Burrows, entitled, 'The Antiquity
of the Cinque Ports Charters'.<a id="footnotetagcp1" name="footnotetagcp1"></a><a href="#footnotecp1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>So far as regards my French analogies, Professor Burrows adopts
the argument that I have not proved a parallel sufficiently close and
complete. But this does not meet my contention: (1) that in the
Cinque Ports organization we find peculiar words and things;
(2) that these peculiarities are not found elsewhere in England;
(3) that they are found in France. Admitting, however, that 'the
earliest title is Norman French', the Professor urges that Edward the
Confessor was a 'half-Norman king', and that 'nothing is more
likely than that he should grant his charter to the Confederation
under a Norman name'.<a id="footnotetagcp2" name="footnotetagcp2"></a><a href="#footnotecp2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>This brings us at once to Edward's alleged charter; and, indeed,
my critic recurs at the outset to his belief in 'the Ports having been
chartered as a Confederation by Edward the Confessor' (p. 439).
At the close of the article he reminds us again that he 'accepted the
charter of Edward the Confessor as a faithful landmark, and showed
how the history of our early kings and their institutions appeared
to coincide with the statement'. But he adds that 'if proof can be
brought against the issue of such a charter', he will be 'the first to
recognize it'.</p>

<p>It is curious that my critic cannot perceive what must be obvious
to all those who are familiar with 'the history of our early kings and
their institutions', namely that the <i>onus probandi</i> rests, not, as he
alleges, on those who question, but on those who maintain the
startling proposition that Edward the Confessor issued such a
charter of incorporation. Nothing short of proof positive could induce
us to accept so unheard-of an anticipation of later times.
That proof Professor Burrows claims to find in the great charter
of Edward I to the Ports. He contends that, according to this document,
Edward 'saw' the Confessor's charter,<a id="footnotetagcp3" name="footnotetagcp3"></a><a href="#footnotecp3"><sup>3</sup></a>
and blames me for omitting its statement to that effect (p. 443). Unfortunately
he quotes the words, as indeed he had done in his book, from an
English translation only, and that a misleading one. The actual
words (as given by Jeake), confirm to the Ports their liberties as
held:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page425" id="page425"></a>[pg 425]</span></p>

<blockquote><p>
temporibus Regum Angli&aelig; Edwardi, Willelmi primi et secundi, Henrici
regis proavi nostri, et temporibus Regis Richardi et Regis Johannis avi
nostri et Domini Henrici Regis patris nostri per cartas eorundem, sicut
cart&aelig; ill&aelig; quas iidem Barones nostri inde habent, et quas inspeximus, rationabiliter
testantur.
</p></blockquote>

<p>In this peculiar wording we notice two points: (1) that it divides the
kings into two groups, and that Henry II is placed in the first group,
not, as we should expect, with his sons; (2) that Edward does not say
that he has 'inspected' charters of all the kings named, but only
'cart&aelig; <i>ill&aelig;</i> quas iidem Barones nostri inde habent'.<a id="footnotetagcp4" name="footnotetagcp4"></a><a href="#footnotecp4"><sup>4</sup></a>
I claim, therefore, to read the words as not implying that Edward had actually
seen any charter older than that of Richard, whose name heads
what I have termed the second group of kings. It is noteworthy
that Richard's is the earliest charter of which the contents are
known to ourselves.</p>

<p>But let us see how the matter stands with reference to previous
charters. Professor Burrows holds that the form of Edward I's
charter 'certainly supposes that the former charters were granted' also
to the Ports collectively.<a id="footnotetagcp5" name="footnotetagcp5"></a><a href="#footnotecp5"><sup>5</sup></a>
Indeed, he 'need not point out', we read,
'that the charters referred to are charters to the Confederation,
not to separate Ports' (p. 444). Where do we find them? 'That the
charter of Henry,' we are told (p. 439), 'which we know about from
those of his sons, has no more survived than those of his predecessors,
has always seemed to me an argument of some weight.' But no
charter of Henry II to the Confederation is spoken of by his sons.
We have in the <cite>Rotuli Chartarum</cite> what Professor Burrows terms,
'the series of six charters, dated June 6, and 7, 1205'. Each Port on
this occasion received a separate charter, and in each case reference
is made to that Port's charter from Henry II. Of a collective charter
we hear nothing. Nor are John's charters even identical in form: to
quote once more Professor Burrows:</p>

<blockquote><p>
It should also be noted that the franchises of Sandwich are to be such as
the town enjoyed in the reigns of 'William and Henry'; of Dover, as in that
of Edward'; of Hythe, as in those of 'Edward, William I, William II, and
Henry'.<a id="footnotetagcp6" name="footnotetagcp6"></a><a href="#footnotecp6"><sup>6</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>And in none of them is any charter mentioned earlier than that of
Henry II.</p>

<p>These charters of John are most important, but have not, so far
as I know, received scientific treatment. The charter to Hastings is
in many ways distinct from the others. It alone speaks of the
'Honours at Court', the rights at Yarmouth, and the ship-service
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page426" id="page426"></a>[pg 426]</span>
due, and alone mentions that this service was rendered 'pro hiis
libertatibus'. The charter to Rye and Winchelsea is modelled on
that of Hastings, and neither of them goes back beyond the charter
of Henry II. The charters to Dover and to Hythe, it will be found,
are closely parallel, and in both cases the privileges are to be
enjoyed as in the times of Edward, William I, William II, and
Henry (I). Sandwich has her liberties confirmed as in the days of
Henry I, King William, 'and our predecessors'; Romney as in the
days of Henry I.</p>

<p>If it be urged that the rights of Yarmouth, though only specified
in the Hastings charter, were included under general liberties in
the charters to the other Ports, I appeal, in reply, to that writ of
Henry II<a id="footnotetagcp7" name="footnotetagcp7"></a><a href="#footnotecp7"><sup>7</sup></a>
which treats the Barons of Hastings alone as possessing
authority at Yarmouth. The charter and the writ confirm one
another.</p>

<p>We see, then, that when we interpret the great charter of Edward
I to the Ports (1278) in the light of evidence, not of supposition, we
find that Henry II and John did grant separate charters to the different
Ports as to other towns (not a collective charter to them all),
and that these therefore must have been the charters referred to in
the general confirmation of 1278. In other words, it was Edward I,
not Edward the Confessor, who granted the first 'Charter to the
Confederation', as a whole. Utterly subversive though it be of
Professor Burrows' view, this is the only conclusion in harmony
with the known facts.</p>

<p>Thus the sole result of examining my critic's evidence is to make
me carry my scepticism further still. I now hold that even so late as
the days of John, the Ports had individual relations to the crown,
although their relations <i>inter se</i> were becoming of a closer character,
as was illustrated by the fact that their several charters were all
obtained at the same time. Hastings alone, as yet, had rights at
Yarmouth recognized: hers were the only portsmen styled 'barons'
by the crown.</p>

<p>It is always, in these matters, necessary to bear in mind that the
local organization was apt to be ahead of the crown, and that
communal institutions and municipal developments might be
winked at for a time to avoid formal recognition. In this way I
believe the rights and privileges belonging in strictness to Hastings
alone were gradually extended in practice to the other ports. There
is, for instance, a St Bertin charter granted by the so-called 'barons
of Dover', although the formal legend on their seal styles them only
'burgesses'. The portsmen may all in practice have been loosely
styled 'barons', even though Hastings alone had a special right to
that distinction. Professor Burrows speaks of 'its acknowledged
claim to be the Premier Port of the Confederation' as 'a circumstance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page427" id="page427"></a>[pg 427]</span>
of the greatest significance in our inquiry',<a id="footnotetagcp8" name="footnotetagcp8"></a><a href="#footnotecp8"><sup>8</sup></a>
and here I entirely agree with him. But I cannot think his explanation of that pre-eminence
in any way satisfactory. He lays great stress on 'the identification
lately established beyond any reasonable doubt between the
town in the Bourne valley and the "New Burgh" of Domesday
Book'. I have searched long and in vain for this identification, but,
whether it be accepted or not, it throws no light on the old town,
the King's town, of Hastings.<a id="footnotetagcp9" name="footnotetagcp9"></a><a href="#footnotecp9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>The importance of Hastings before the Conquest is shown not
only by the action of its ships in 1049, but also by its possessing a
mint. Yet the only mention of this town in Domesday is the incidental
entry that the Abbot of F&eacute;camp had 'in Hastings' appurtenant
to his Manor of Brede, 'iiii. burgenses et xiiii. bordarios'.<a id="footnotetagcp10" name="footnotetagcp10"></a><a href="#footnotecp10"><sup>10</sup></a>
One is fairly driven to the bold hypothesis that Hastings, which ought to
have figured at the head of the county survey (as did Dover in
Kent), was one of the important towns wholly omitted in Domesday.<a id="footnotetagcp11" name="footnotetagcp11"></a><a href="#footnotecp11"><sup>11</sup></a>
The fact that its ship-service, when first mentioned, was as
large as that of Dover is a further proof of its importance.</p>

<p>The geographical position of Hastings also severs its case, as
widely as do its privileges, from those of the Kentish ports. It is
therefore difficult to resist the impression that the distinction in
John's charter had a real origin and meaning. The 'barons' of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page428" id="page428"></a>[pg 428]</span>
Hastings were, I believe, the men of the <em>King's</em> town (not, as alleged,
the Abbot's) and so far from the Abbot's men being admitted to
share their distinction, we find the latter, at Rye and Winchelsea,
styled in John's charter 'homines', not even 'homines nostri'.</p>

<p>The accepted view as to Rye and Winchelsea is thus set forth by
Professor Burrows:</p>

<blockquote><p>
The Confessor had evidently intended to make the little group of Sussex
towns, the 'New Burgh', Winchelsea, and Rye, a strong link of communication
between England and Normandy; but Godwin and Harold had contrived
to prevent the two latter from becoming the property of the Abbey of
F&eacute;camp, to which Edward granted them in the early part of his reign; and
this formed one of the Norman grievances. William promised to restore
them to the Abbey, and when he had conquered England he kept his word....
Of the grant of Winchelsea and Rye to the same Abbey as part of the
lands of Steyning we have distinct evidence in the charter of resumption
issued by Henry III in 1247 (p. 27; cf. <i>supra</i>, p. 248).
</p></blockquote>

<p>Although this view has always been held by local historians and
antiquaries, it seems to me obvious that there must be error somewhere.
Rye and Winchelsea belonged geographically to the Abbey's
lordship of Brede in the extreme west of the county; its lordship of
Steyning was in East Sussex. On examining for myself the charter of
resumption and comparing it with the Abbey's claims as to Brede
at the <i>quo warranto</i> inquiry, I discovered the solution of the mystery.
Rye and Winchelsea were not, as alleged, appurtenant to Steyning,
but belonged to the Manor of Brede. The Abbey, however, claimed
on behalf of its Manor of Brede (including Rye and Winchelsea) all
the franchises granted to Steyning, contending that they were
meant to extend to all its lands in Sussex. This claim was urged and
recognized in the case of the charter of resumption (1246), the source
of the whole misapprehension.</p>

<p>But to return to the 'barons', Professor Burrows, discussing the
title, writes thus:<a id="footnotetagcp12" name="footnotetagcp12"></a><a href="#footnotecp12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<blockquote><p>
It is admitted that the title was at first only held by the Portsmen in
common with the citizens of several other places, as that of a responsible
man in a privileged community, of a 'baro' or 'vir' of some dignity; but,
of course, not in the least in the sense of a 'baron' such as the word came to
mean in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.
</p></blockquote>

<p>I do not know which were these 'several other places'; but I think
the word 'baron' can be shown to have here had a definite connotation.
The exemption from 'wardship and marriage', for instance,
granted by Edward I (1278), implies that these 'barons' were subject
to the burdens of tenants-in-chief, while their extraordinary
appeal, after the battle of St Mah&eacute; (1293), to 'the judgment of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page429" id="page429"></a>[pg 429]</span>
peers, earls, and barons'<a id="footnotetagcp13" name="footnotetagcp13"></a><a href="#footnotecp13"><sup>13</sup></a>
has not, so far as I know, received the
attention it deserves. By such a phrase the Cinque Ports 'barons'
virtually claimed the privilege of peers of the realm.</p>

<p>But one must not wander too far along these tempting paths. When
tradition is replaced, as it may be in part, by evidence, we shall have,
not improbably, to unlearn much that now passes current as genuine
Cinque Ports history. On the other hand, there may be in store for us
glimpses of much that is interesting and new.<a id="footnotetagcp14" name="footnotetagcp14"></a><a href="#footnotecp14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>Apart, however, from problems as yet difficult and obscure, we
shall be standing on sure ground in asserting that the charter of
Edward I is the first that was granted to the Ports collectively,
and that the rights and liberties it confirmed were those which had
been granted to the separate ports by Henry II and John, and which
it then made uniform and applicable to the whole confederation.
As at London,<a id="footnotetagcp15" name="footnotetagcp15"></a><a href="#footnotecp15"><sup>15</sup></a>
we have always to remember that communal institutions
might develop locally before their existence is proved by the
crown's formal recognition. Delay in that recognition is not proof
of their non-existence. What complicates so greatly the study of the
Cinque Ports polity is the difficulty of disentangling its three component
elements: the old English institutions common to other towns;
the special relation to the crown in connection with their ship-service;
and the foreign or communal factor on which I have myself
insisted. No impartial student, I believe, will deny that I have fairly
established the existence of this third element. Its relative importance
and its sphere of action must remain, of course, as yet matter of
conjecture.</p>

The Professor's argument that 'the lordship of St Denis over the Saxon
Hastings had ceased&mdash;probably when the Northmen took possession of the Seine
valley and blocked out the French; that of F&eacute;camp was the renewal of the old idea
on an adjoining territory' (<cite>Cinque Ports</cite>, p. 27), is as baseless as that which follows
it as to Winchelsea and Rye. For the 'charter of Offa, king of the Mercians' (p.
25), granting Hastings to St Denis, has been conclusively shown by Mr Stevenson
to be a forgery.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="footnotecp10" name="footnotecp10"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotetagcp10"><sup>10</sup></a>
One cannot, of course, speak positively without seeing that 'identification'
on which Professor Burrows relies. But, unless there is evidence to the contrary, it
seems difficult to resist the conclusion that this estate of the Abbey 'in Hastings'
was identical with that which it actually possessed in the Bourne Valley. For this
by no means included the whole 'town in the Bourne Valley', but only that portion
of it at the foot of the West Hill, which is bordered by Courthouse Street, Bourne
Street, John Street, and High Street, together with St Clement's Church and
its block of buildings (<cite>Sussex Arch. Coll.</cite>, xiv. 67). And this conclusion is strengthened
by the fact that in Domesday its rents are 63s 'in Hastings', and 158s in the
'novus burgus', while at the Dissolution they were only 35s 4d in Hastings. In that
case we must after all look for the 'novus burgus' of Domesday at Winchelsea or
Rye.</p>

<p class="footnote">Nor is the history of Hastings harbour at all as clear as could be wished. 'The
ancient Harbour once occupied', no doubt, 'Priory Valley' (<cite>Cinque Ports</cite>, p. 9);
but I can find no trace of a haven 'formed by the Bourne between the East and
West Hills', which replaced it on its silting-up. On the contrary, the old map of
Hastings in 1746 (<cite>Sussex Arch. Coll.</cite>, vol. xii) shows us the 'haven' (with ships)
in the Priory Valley to the west of the Castle Hill. Was not this a later harbour
(1637), and the real original one out to the south?]</p>

The courts of the Cinque Ports, for instance, greatly need investigation. One
can only throw out as a mere conjecture the suggestion that if the Court of Guestling
derived its name, as Professor Burrows admits is probable, from Guestling (the
<i>caput</i> of a Hundred), midway between Hastings and Winchelsea, it may have been
originally a <i>Sussex</i> Court for the Hastings group, while the Court of Broadhill&mdash;afterwards
'Broderield' and 'Brotherhood' (<cite>The Cinque Ports</cite>, p. 178)&mdash;may have
been the Kentish one. The admitted corruption in the traditional derivation of
both names, together with the court's change of <i>locale</i>, shows how much obscurity
surrounds their true origin. Few, I think, would accept Professor Burrows' view
that, because the Brodhull, when we first have record of it, was held 'near the
village of Dymchurch' (p. 46), it was named from 'the "broad hill" of Dymchurch,
which may well have been some portion of the wall which extended for three miles
along the beach' (p. 47). As the Guestling was not a court of 'Guests', so 'the broad
hill', from which the meeting derived its name, must have been originally somewhere
else than down 'on Dymchurch beach' (p. 75), between Romney Marsh
and the sea.</p>

<p>Pages <a href="#page20">20</a>, <a href="#page107">107</a>. In case I should not have made sufficiently clear my
views as to the filiation of the Domesday MSS., it may be well to
explain that what I deny on p. <a href="#page21">21</a> is that the <cite>Inq. Com. Cant.</cite> and the
<cite>Inq. El.</cite> can both have been copied from a third document intermediate
between them and the original returns. But, as I state on
pp. <a href="#page20">20</a>, <a href="#page123">123</a>, it cannot be <em>proved</em> that the <cite>Inq. Com. Cant.</cite> was itself transcribed
direct from the original returns, as it might, possibly, be only
a copy of an earlier transcript of these returns.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#page30">30</a>. A remarkable instance of the occasional untrustworthiness
of the figures given in these texts is afforded by the Manors of
Stretham and Wilburton, co. Cambridgeshire, which were farmed
together. The correct figures for their ploughteams were these:</p>

<table summary="ploughteams" border="0">

<p>The footnotes show the errors.</p>

<p>Thus the A text, which is the best known, gives two figures out of
three wrongly for Wilburton, and Mr Pell, by accepting as genuine
these two erroneous figures, was led to quite erroneous conclusions.</p>

<p>Pages <a href="#page68">68</a>-9. The parallel for this system of counting by threes and
sixes is found in the wergild of Scandinavia, with its <i>r&eacute;tt</i> of 3 marcs,
or 6, or 12, the 6 or the 12 <i>aurar</i>, the 12 ells or the 12 feet of <i>vadmal</i>.</p>

<p>For the <i>formul&aelig;</i> on p. <a href="#page68">68</a> an instructive parallel is found in the
Frostathing's Law:</p>

<blockquote><p>
If a <i>haulld</i> wounds a man, he is liable to pay 6 <i>baugar</i>(rings) to the king,
and 12 <i>aurar</i> are in each ring ... a <i>lendrmann</i> 12, a jarl 24, a king 48, 12 <i>aurar</i>
being in each ring.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus we find in Scandinavia the counterpart of the system of
counting found in the 'Danish' districts of England, just as we find
in Angeln and Ditmarsh the counterpart of the 'hide', with its four
'yards', found in southern England (<cite>Arch&aelig;ologia</cite>, xxxvii. 380).</p>

<p>Page <a href="#page105">105</a>. For the election of <i>juratores</i> we may compare the
Abingdon Abbey case, under Henry II: 'ex utroque parte seniores
viri eligerentur qui secundum quod eis verum videretur ... jurarent;
... segregati qui jurarent diversis opinionibus causam suam confundebant'.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page431" id="page431"></a>[pg 431]</span>
For juries of eight or sixteen we may compare Jocelin de
Brakelonde's narrative of a suit for an advowson in 1191: 'delatum
est juramentum per consensum utriusque partis sexdecim legalibus
de hundredo'.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#page126">126</a>. Compare here Mr Freeman's text (iii. 413-4):</p>

<blockquote><p>
There can be little doubt that William's ravages were not only done
systematically, but were done with a fixed and politic purpose.... It is
impossible to doubt that the systematic harrying of the whole country round
Hastings was done with the deliberate purpose of provoking the English
king.... The work was done with a completeness which shows that it was
something more than the mere passing damage wrought by an enemy in
need of food.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Domesday is appealed to, as in the Appendix, for this view.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#page205">205</a>. Though I have spoken in the text of <em>William</em> de Montfichet,
following, like Dugdale, the <cite>Liber Niger</cite>, I have since found
that the tenant of the fief, in 1166, was his son Gilbert, the <cite>carta</cite>
being wrongly assigned in the <cite>Liber Niger</cite> itself to William. There are
similar and instructive errors to be found in it.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#page244">244</a>. The succession of Schelin, the Domesday under-tenant
by his son Robert, in 1095 identifies the former with Schelin,
the Dorset tenant-in-chief, from whom Shilling Ockford took its
name, and who was succeeded in Dorset also by his son Robert
(<cite>Montacute Cartulary</cite>).</p>

<p>Pages <a href="#page293">293</a>-4. To guard (as I have to do at every turn) against
misrepresentation, I may explain that the Battle Chronicle is the
primary authority I follow for the feigned flight. Its words 'fugam,
cum exercitu duce simulante', distinctly assert that the Duke himself,
with the main body of his army, 'turned in seeming flight'.
It must, surely, be because this evidence is quite opposed to Mr
Freeman's view that he ignored it in his text (pp. 488-90). The
essential point to grasp, according to my own view, is that a detachment,
told off for the purpose, thrust itself between the pursuing
English and the hill to cut off their retreat, and that the main body
of the Normans then faced about. The English, one may add, are
hardly likely to have ventured down into the plain unless the feigned
flight was so general as to make them think they could safely do
so.</p>

<p>Pages <a href="#page311">311</a>-12. 'Mainly from oral tradition.' This refers, of course,
to Mr Archer's contention.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#page356">356</a>. On the great influence, by their connection, of the
Clares see also the <cite>Becket Memorials</cite> (iii. 43), where Fitz Stephen
writes (1163):</p>

<blockquote><p>
Illi autem comiti de Clara fere omnes nobiles Angli&aelig; propinquitate
adh&aelig;rebant, qui et pulcherrimam totius regni sororem habebat, quam rex
aliquando concupierat.
</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page432" id="page432"></a>[pg 432]</span></p>

<p>We are reminded here of the curious story in the <cite>Monasticon</cite> (iv.
608) that, some forty years before, Roheis de Clare, the wife of
Eudo Dapifer, was, on his death (1120), destined by her brethren
for the second wife of Henry I, a story which illustrates, at least, the
position attributed to the family.</p>

<p>Pages <a href="#page357">357</a>-8. The Montfichet match is not shown in the chart
pedigree, nor is the important marriage of Adeliza, another daughter
of Gilbert (fitz Richard) de Clare, to Aubrey de Vere, the Chamberlain,
which is well ascertained (<cite>Geoffrey de Mandeville</cite>, pp. 390-2).
By him she had <i>inter alios</i> a daughter, with the Clare name of 'Rohese',
who married Geoffrey de Mandeville, first Earl of Essex (<cite>ibid.</cite>).
The existence of this Adeliza may be held to be against my affiliation
of 'Adelidis de Tunbridge', which avowedly is only a conjecture.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#page360">360</a>. A chart pedigree is here given to illustrate the connection
of Robert fitz Richard (de Clare), through his wife, with the
Earls of Northampton and the Scottish kings:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 420px"><img src="images/432-420.png" width="420" height="300" alt="Family tree" /></div>

<p>Robert fitz Richard and his children (see p. <a href="#page359">359</a>) are included in
this pedigree, in order to show that their ages present no chronological
difficulty, and that the length of time they survived him is
clearly due to his marrying rather late in life.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#page388">388</a>. I have identified a third fine, since this book was
in type, as belonging to the great circuits of 1176. It proves that they
began early in the year.</p>

<p>As a corollary to my conclusions on pp. <a href="#page386">386</a>-7, I should like to
allude to the well-known changes in 1178-80. Great importance is
attached to the passage in the <cite>Gesta Regis Henrici</cite>, which describes
how the king selected five justices 'de privata familia sua' in the
place of the eighteen previously appointed, who as I read the
passage, were to accompany his court. I cannot think that this
reform, if it took place, enured, for the central body that we really
meet with from 1179 onwards is, it seems to me, distinctly different.
It consists of the Bishops of Winchester, Ely, and Norwich, whom,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page433" id="page433"></a>[pg 433]</span>
says R. de Diceto, in a passage to which the Bishop of Oxford rightly
draws attention, Henry, in 1179, appointed 'archijustitiarios regni',
with Glanvill, who soon became a chief justiciar with them. These
four continue to hold a position severed from that of the other
justices, of whom some act with them at one time and some at
another. The earliest appearance at present known to me of this
well-defined central group is at Oxford, February 11, 1180. We
there find the three bishops associated with five justices, headed by
Ranulf Glanvill, recorded on a fine. Now, we happen to know that
the king was at Oxford about this very time, for he decided there
on the issue of his new coinage.<a id="footnotetagadd4" name="footnotetagadd4"></a><a href="#footnoteadd4"><sup>4</sup></a> His presence would account for this
gathering of the four leading justiciars, so that we need not hesitate
to connect the two phenomena. We have then here record evidence
of the true <i>personnel</i> at the time of the central judicial body, together
with the fact of its presence with the king, the fact which had not
till now been proved, on his progress through the land.</p>

If readers have difficulty seeing them on mobile or handheld devices, they are

<p>The ligature &aelig; is not necessarily consistent in its use, e.g.
  'medi&aelig;val' is used more in Part I of this book, but not in Part II;
  'mediaeval' is used in both parts.</p>

<p>The original book contained a Foreword, which is not present in the
scans from which this book derives.</p>

<p>'Foreword ... page 7' has been removed from the Table of Contents.</p>

<p>'Stamford Bridge' and 'Stamfordbridge' both appear more than once in this book, and in the First edition.
Two instances of 'Stamfordbridge' have been corrected to 'Stamford Bridge', to correspont to the First edition.</p>

<p>Page 323 (in Chaper '<span class="sc">regenbald, priest and chancellor</span>'): A Charter in
Anglo-Saxon has been restored from the 1st edition (1895).</p>

<p>Anglo-Saxon letters in this Charter include:</p>

<ul class="none">

<li>&#254; = lower-case thorn;</li>
<li>&#503; = Capital Wynn;</li>
<li>&#447; = lower-case wynn;</li>
<li>&#240; = lower-case eth;</li>
<li><span class="thornt"> &#42853;</span> (in compliant browsers) = thorn with stroke, an abbreviation for &#254;&aelig;t [&#254;t].</li>
</ul>

<p>&#254; and &#240; are also used elsewhere in the book.</p>

<p>Page 381: The printer has used a symbol to simulate a mediaeval scribe's abbreviarion of 'et':
&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/381-et.png" width="19" height="28" alt="et" />.</p>

<p>This has been replaced in this book by the Tironian (Irish) 'et': <span class="et">&#8266;</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Enlarged:&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="et2">&#8266;</span> )</p>

<p>Pages 412-415: The 2-page table which interrupted the text has been removed
  to the end of the chapter (as it was in the First edition), and the page numbers and footnote numbers amended.</p>

<p>Page 432: 'enured' = 'inured' = (legal) 'took effect', etc.</p>

<h4>Errata</h4>

<p>Many printer's errors, nearly all absent from the first edition, appear
  to have been introduced by a careless printer working from a copy of
  the first edition. Abbreviated titles, 'Mr.', 'Prof.', etc.,
  in the First edition have mostly appeared in this edition as 'Mr',
  'Prof', etc. These have been retained. Incorrect punctuation has been repaired without
  comment, except in the Index. Here the printer of this edition has replaced
  many of the colons of the First edition with commas, and added extra
  commas after sub-listings. These have been retained. Double quotes were used in the first
  edition; single quotes in this edition. This has led to some
  confusion where ' is used for both an abbreviation and a
  following end quote (''). Other errors are listed below.</p>

<p>Page 442: Index numbers: 555, 558-60 removed. Correct for First Edition;
too high for 3rd Impression.</p>

<p class="spaceabove">Index: The Index, in places, was unreliable.</p>

<p>Though most page numbers were correct, some page numbers belonged
  to the First Edition, and had not been correctly translated to this (re-paged) Third Impression, not translated at all, or
  not removed after translation; some were merely incorrect, and a few (important) page numbers were absent. All
  page numbers were checked, and retained, amended, added or deleted
  without TN comment, except where the error was not simply numerical. (Only some 'missing' page numbers have searched for, been found).</p>

<p>As the Footnotes have now been removed from the ends of pages to
  the ends of Chapters, there is no longer the connection from the
  Index page reference to a footnote, which may have held the only
  information on the page for the Index topic. Accordingly, where the
  information sought is only in the footnote, the footnote number, as
  a superscript, has been added to the page number in the Index, e.g.</p>

<p class="ind">Ellis, Mr A. S., <a href="#page249">249</a><sup>7</sup>, <a href="#page257">257</a><sup>43</sup></p>

<p class="spaceabove">Index: 'Feif' corrected to 'Fief'.</p>

<p>Index: 'Beauchamp, Maud de, <a href="#page156">156</a>, <a href="#page158">158</a>-9'.</p>

<p>The reference to p. 158 is to 'Matilda Beauchamp'. 'Matilda' and
  'Maud' were apparently interchangeable, so this reference would
  be correct.</p>

<p>However, p. 159 has:</p>

<p class="ind">"... in their rivalry for Tamworth,<sup>36</sup> the Marmions embraced
    the cause of Stephen, and the Beauchamps that of Maud, their
    variance being terminated under Henry II by a matrimonial
    alliance."</p>

<p>Surely this Maud is not Maud de Beauchamp, as the Index entry implies,
  but the Empress Maud, daughter, and surviving heir, of Henry I,
  and mother of Henry II; and bitter rival of her cousin, Stephen
  of Blois, crowned King of England, while she was not quite
  crowned Queen.</p>
